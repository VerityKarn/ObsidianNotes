Yet, the Summit concluded that they would willingly pursue and accept having both nations join NATO in the future, if conditions changed. In the subsequent years, the membership bid was dropped by NATO, the US, Ukraine, and Georgia. Though, the Russian Federation still cites the Summit as a primary objective of the West as an effort to destabilize Russia.

Author of several books on Russia and International Crime. Part of several groups centered around European Security and Foreign Policy, including Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies(RUSI) and Institute of International Relations(IIR) in Prague. Focus is almost primarily on Russia in current geopolitics. Coined the term Gerasimov Doctrine, though said that it was misunderstood[I'm Sorry for Creating the 'Gerasimov Doctrine'](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/05/im-sorry-for-creating-the-gerasimov-doctrine/)

By all accounts, someone with expertise knowledge regarding Russian history and current Russian foreign policy affairs. The only real gaff I can find on his record is the Gerasimov Doctrine, which he says was mostly mislabeled and slightly confused, though likely more by media handling than his original reporting of it.

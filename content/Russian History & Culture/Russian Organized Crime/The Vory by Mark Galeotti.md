## Notes:

#### Chapter 1 & 2:
- Tsarist Era Criminal elements came from different sources: Rural and City
	- Rural crime was a version of community justice to combat mostly thievery. Given the overall lack of policing, and the rampant bands of horse thieves, communities would usually form their own enforcement groups, which would engage in their own legal process, usually resulting in lynch mobs. Though, there were successful groups of thieves and bandits that typically formed around the Volga River, which created an intricate network of those who would bring stolen goods to port, and ship them elsewhere for fencing.
	- City crime is more of the introduction to Воровской Мир(*Vorovskoi mir*, or Thieve's World). Rapid Industrialization, poor living conditions, and political unrest led to groups of people seeking to mark themselves as opposed to the mainstream culture. In addition, the police were often undermanned, poorly trained(if at all), and often corrupt themselves due to lack of proper oversight. While banditry was still the main criminal activity, the targets(warehouses, nobles, ships) and tactics(pickpocketing, information brokering, racketeering) were more complex. Some even became celebrities.

#### Chapter 3:
- Robberies and gang activity found new allies among revolutionary forces between the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, with Stalin and Lenin using them to access funds for their causes. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^KamoQuote]]
- The Russian Civil War(1918-22), turned the Bolshevik movement into one that focused on survival, which led to criminals previously prosecuted under the Tsar being accepted into the ranks of the political and police forces. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^LeninCriminal]]
- Economic troubles during and immediately after the Civil War appeared to be the first major shift in criminal behavior among the populace. Homelessness and drug use rose significantly, and early policies focused on establishing the new Bolshevik state made progress difficult. Homeless youth especially became a problem. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^YouthViolence]]
- The use of gulags for criminals, including petty and political, created a new environment for criminal elements to better organize, and helped to make the Воровской Мир more stable and powerful over time, with more top-down organization. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^GulagVorovskoiMir]]

#### Chapter 4:
- It appears that much of the later mafia activity found it's foundations within the gulag system, mostly as a reaction towards survival within the strict labour camps.
- One of the more strict laws set by members of the Воровской мир was a complete cut off from cooperating with state actors, including camp guards and elevated prisoners. Though, this led to a divide within the gulags, as more opportunities were present for those that assisted the camp guards with their duties. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^chestnyagy]]
- World War 2 led to many gulag prisoners becoming forcibly recruited into the Red Army for defense, which led to further encroachments into the principles of the Воровской мир. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^order227]]
- Upon return, a sizable portion of soldiers that were prisoners of war would be redirected to the gulags, as punishment for either desertion or betrayal. Further reading([Soviet Repressions against former prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_repressions_against_former_prisoners_of_war)) also suggests that many of these prisoners were not given veteran status, and were typically looked down upon. It is still a matter of debate how many were legitimate defectors, or how many were unfairly punished. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^pows]]
- The influx of former soldiers and various ethnic groups into the gulags changed some of the power balance and hierarchies within the camps, as new groups would form that did not strictly adhere to the rudimentary rule system of the вори.
- This led to what is assumed a government supported move against the блатне, or the Traditionalist thieves, and the суки, the 'bitches' or state collaborators. In the span of several years after the war, violence escalated between the groups, with the Traditionalists quickly losing numbers, which was beneficially for the authorities, as they were the anti-state group. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^bitcheswar]]
- In the end, the decade after Stalin's death led to rapid depopulation within the gulags, with many of the first released to be the суки, who still considered themselves to be part of the воровской мир, but also believed in working with the state when it was to their advantage.

## Notable Quotes:

### Chapter 1:

>Instead, order in the village was largely the preserve of *samosud* (‘self-judging’), a surprisingly nuanced form of lynch law, whereby the members of the commune applied their own moral code to offenders, regardless or even in defiance of the state’s laws. This has been best studied by Cathy Frierson, who concluded that – contrary to the opinions of many police and state officials of the time – it was not mindless violence but a process with its own logic and its own principles.
>-Page 14

>The Russian language contains two very distinct words for crime: *prestupleniye*, an essentially technical definition, a breach of the law, and *zlodeyanie*, which carries with it a moral judgement.32 Tellingly, the peasant proverb had it that ‘God punishes sins, and the state punishes guilt’. Such poaching may have been *prestupleniye*, but the peasants certainly did not see it as *zlodeyanie* because the landlord had more than enough wood for his personal needs, and ‘God grew the forest for everyone’. It could even be interpreted as an act of social banditry, a petty redistribution of wealth from the exploiter to the exploited. In the eyes of the eighteenth-century traveller the Marquis de Custine, the serfs had to be ‘on guard against their masters, who \[were\] constantly acting towards them with open and shameless bad faith’, and so they in turn would ‘compensate themselves by artifice what they suffer through injustice’.
>-Page 16

### Chapter 2:

>The urban gangster was a product of the slums of a rapidly urbanising late-tsarist Russia, the so-called yamy, where life was cheap and miserable. It was in the drinking dens and dosshouses of the yamy that the subculture of the vorovskoi mir emerged, the ‘thieves’ world’. Its code, of separation from and contempt for mainstream society and its values – nation, church, family, charity – became one of the few unifying forces within this milieu, and would become a central part of the macho beliefs of the twentieth-century Russian vory. It was not that the criminals had no codes or values, but rather that they picked, chose and invented them as best suited their needs.
>-Page 22

>‘Mishka Yaponchik’ – his real name was Mikhail Vinnitsky – was a particular such legend in his own lifetime. The son of a carter, given his nickname ‘the Japanese’ apparently for his bony face and dark, slanted eyes, he was an ambitious and audacious gangster from an early age, with the charisma to attract others of the same mould to his side. He soon acquired a formidable reputation in Odessa and the police would reportedly turn a blind eye so long as he avoided them and left the neighbourhoods of the rich be. As he rose to become the foremost mobster of the city, he became rich on tributes from other gangs and extorted from businesses. He made no efforts to hide this status, promenading through the most fashionable haunts in a dandyish cream-coloured suit, bow tie and straw boater, always accompanied by his bodyguards. He would hold court in Café Fankoni, where a table was always reserved for him, alongside the city’s other successful businessmen. From time to time, like any magnanimous monarch, he would hold street parties, with tin buckets of vodka and tables of free food. ‘Yaponchik’ would end up a casualty of the post-revolutionary civil war, killed in Voznesensk in 1920, but for five years the so-called ‘King of the Moldavanka’ would stand as a symbol of the Odessan gangster made good.

### Chapter 3:

>Stalin does not seem to have been a triggerman or safecracker himself, but rather a fixer who found common cause with ‘thieves’ in it for the money, not (or at least not only) for the ideology. In 1907, for example, he organised the ambush of a stagecoach carrying cash to the Imperial Bank in Tbilisi, in which almost forty people died under a hail of gunfire and improvised grenades. The gangsters fled with a third of a million rubles, although most of this haul ended up unusable because it was in large-denomination notes whose serial numbers were quickly circulated throughout Europe. The actual rough stuff was in the hands of a ruthless Armenian, Simon Ter-Petrossian, known as ‘Kamo’, who already had his own gang and was as much a *vor* as a revolutionary.

>By identifying the rich and the petty criminal as the enemies of socialism, Lenin was implicitly exempting the not-so-petty criminal, making him a potential ally. This was just one of the compromises made during the civil war that would shape the rest of the Soviet era. Although the new government adopted draconian policies – the Military Revolutionary Committee warned that ‘at the first attempt by dark elements to cause confusion, robbery, bloodshed or shooting on the streets of Petrograd, the criminal responsible will be wiped off the face of the earth’ – in practice ‘confusion, robbery, bloodshed or shooting’ abounded. In 1918, robberies and murders were at ten to fifteen times the prewar level and Lenin himself was not immune to the lawlessness of the period.
>Page 38 ^LeninCriminal

>The phenomenon of *besprizornost* would survive through the 1920s, and bring with it the associated challenges of begging, theft and even violence. Tales abounded – sometimes exaggerated, but sadly too often accurate – of gangs of teenagers or even younger children not only engaging in petty theft but mobbing and sometimes killing victims in gangs ten, twenty, thirty strong. Joseph Douillet, the last Belgian consul to the prewar USSR, witnessed the endgame to a rising in the Persianovka children’s camp, where some twenty-five youths from Novocherkassk armed themselves with knives and guns and took the camp, holding it for almost a week before soldiers came to restore order.
>-Page 40 ^YouthViolence

>Through this constant mingling of criminals from across the Soviet Union, the *vorovskoi mir* became ever more homogeneous and interconnected, a veritable ‘gangster archipelago’. In the process, the camp system strengthened and transmitted this distinctive subculture, at once enforcing and teaching underworld orthodoxy. Thus, for example, Vyatlag camp was described in its own prison newspaper, *Za zheleznoi reshyotkoi* (‘Behind Iron Bars’), as ‘a real school’ offering ‘courses of the second stage of moral training for future skilled, “stylish” criminals’. This was not just about indoctrinating criminals into a common culture, it was also about the communication of professional skills. In its own vicious way, the Stalin regime was bringing about rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and, as during late tsarism, this generated increased specialisation and stratification within the underworld, just as for the rest of society. Such professional classifiers ranged from the *farmazonshiki*, counterfeit-currency dealers (who would also often palm *kukly*, ‘dolls’, onto unwitting marks: a bundle of fake notes or even just scrap paper, with real notes at the top and bottom to fool the eye), to the *gonsha* (‘shoe’), a pickpocket working the crowded buses and trams at rush hour.
>-Page 45 ^GulagVorovskoiMir

>The key point is that the camp system was the crucible in which the loose vorovskoi mir that had emerged in late nineteenth-century Russia would not only become increasingly homogeneous, including embracing non-Slavic nationalities, but also acquire what it had always lacked, some kind of hierarchy. The dog-eat-dog struggle for daily survival in the Gulags, summar-ised in the precept ‘you die today, and I’ll die tomorrow’, only deepened the cultural ties amongst the blatnye, and the gulf between them and the rest of society.
>-Page 47

### Chapter 4:

>Just as Stalin’s policies unified the vorovskoi mir on one level, they also divided it on another, creating a new body of collaborators, the so-called suki (‘bitches’), who were willing to help the state run the Gulags, but only in their own interests. The challenge for the Stalinist state was how best to manage the massive influx of convicts, and to do so cheaply and efficiently. While the primary initial motivation of the purges and the mass incarcerations was political, the state also sought to exploit this virtually enslaved workforce for economic gain. As a Polish-born zek, Gustav Herling, put it, ‘the whole system of forced labour in Soviet Russia – in all its stages, the interrogations and hearings, the preliminary imprisonment, and the camp itself – is intended primarily not to punish the criminal, but rather to exploit him economically and transform him psychologically’.
>-Page 51

>Nonetheless, especially by the later 1930s, even members of the vorovskoi mir became tempted by the opportunities of collaboration. The traditionalists within the vorovskoi mir despised these quislings. They became outcasts, the otoshedshie (‘departed’), more commonly and vitriolically known as suki (‘bitches’). Their lives were forfeit in the eyes of the blatnye, who increasingly also called themselves chestnyagy, ‘the unconverted’.
>-Page 52 ^chestnyagy

>People’s Defence Committee Order No. 227, issued following the disaster that was the decimation of the Soviet defensive line in the initial German onslaught, envisaged that hundreds of thousands of convicts would be rushed to penal battalions, originally punishment units for deserters and malcontents. In the first three years of the war, almost a million Gulag inmates were transferred into the Red Army.
>-Page 54 ^order227

>The vory and regular criminals who had served in the army and were now considered to have broken their code were joined by maybe half a million former soldiers and partisans whose ‘crime’ had been to be captured by the enemy when Stalin expected – demanded – that they fight to the death. For them, ‘liberation’ meant an inglorious transfer from a foreign prison camp to a Soviet one. Over a third of a million Red Army soldiers ended up in the NKVD’s ‘verification and filtration camps’, and while most were eventually freed to civilian life or returned into the military, at least a third of them ended up in the Gulag.
>-Page 54 ^pows

>Increasingly, camp authorities actively began to seek to convert or break the traditionalists. Varlam Shalamov, for example, recounted the tale he had heard in 1948, of convicts arriving at Vanino transit prison forced to strip, so that the thieves could be identified by their tattoos.21 They were offered the choice between ritually forsaking their code and death, with many choosing the latter. It is unclear if this actually happened, or whether it was just one of the myths that circulate in any information-scarce society, but the authorities certainly did use the blatnye’s own customs against them, not least identifying them by their ink. They also demanded that traditionalists publicly recant their old ways, by carrying out some symbolic act of labour (such as raking the forbidden zone between fences, which was kept cleared to show footprints), locking the door of a barracks, and sitting and eating with other collaborators. That way, they were irredeemably ‘departed’ from the blatnoi community, and could not go back.
>-Page 57

>In terms of the big picture, the collaborators won, for a variety of reasons. They often had numbers on their side, and the ex-soldiers brought with them military experience: the blatnye might be tough individually, but so were their enemies, and many of them were used to fighting as units. Perhaps most importantly, the suki had the support of the regime. The authorities found a variety of ways to tilt the balance, whether by allowing them to dominate camp careers such as cook and barber – which meant knives and razors – or by giving them access to work tools such as axes and shovels. They could also move groups of prisoners like armies in the field, concentrating them in individual camps until they had wiped out the blatnye there, and then moving them on to the next.
>-Page 58 ^bitcheswar

>So the suki had won, albeit at the cost of playing their part in rendering the Gulags virtually ungovernable. Nonetheless, win they did, and reshaped the vorovskoi mir in their own image. They retained most of the code, and the culture of brazen and merciless dog-eat-dog predation, but they rewrote the prohibition on collaboration with the state. It now became permissible, so long as it was in the criminal’s interest. When the Gulags were opened, these collaborator-criminals were amongst the first to be released, and over the following decade they would impose their own vision of the code across the Soviet underworld, by threat, persuasion and violence. The way would be open for a new generation of vory to collaborate with dishonest Party functionaries when they felt it was in their interests. This was Stalin’s toxic legacy to the Soviet Union.

# Notes:

## Part 1 - Foundations:
### Chapter 1 & 2:
- Tsarist Era Criminal elements came from different sources: Rural and City
	- Rural crime was a version of community justice to combat mostly thievery. Given the overall lack of policing, and the rampant bands of horse thieves, communities would usually form their own enforcement groups, which would engage in their own legal process, usually resulting in lynch mobs. Though, there were successful groups of thieves and bandits that typically formed around the Volga River, which created an intricate network of those who would bring stolen goods to port, and ship them elsewhere for fencing.
	- City crime is more of the introduction to Воровской Мир(*Vorovskoi mir*, or Thieve's World). Rapid Industrialization, poor living conditions, and political unrest led to groups of people seeking to mark themselves as opposed to the mainstream culture. In addition, the police were often undermanned, poorly trained(if at all), and often corrupt themselves due to lack of proper oversight. While banditry was still the main criminal activity, the targets(warehouses, nobles, ships) and tactics(pickpocketing, information brokering, racketeering) were more complex. Some even became celebrities.

### Chapter 3:
- Robberies and gang activity found new allies among revolutionary forces between the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, with Stalin and Lenin using them to access funds for their causes. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^KamoQuote]]
- The Russian Civil War(1918-22), turned the Bolshevik movement into one that focused on survival, which led to criminals previously prosecuted under the Tsar being accepted into the ranks of the political and police forces. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^LeninCriminal]]
- Economic troubles during and immediately after the Civil War appeared to be the first major shift in criminal behavior among the populace. Homelessness and drug use rose significantly, and early policies focused on establishing the new Bolshevik state made progress difficult. Homeless youth especially became a problem. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^YouthViolence]]
- The use of gulags for criminals, including petty and political, created a new environment for criminal elements to better organize, and helped to make the Воровской Мир more stable and powerful over time, with more top-down organization. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^GulagVorovskoiMir]]

### Chapter 4:
- It appears that much of the later mafia activity found it's foundations within the gulag system, mostly as a reaction towards survival within the strict labour camps.
- One of the more strict laws set by members of the Воровской мир was a complete cut off from cooperating with state actors, including camp guards and elevated prisoners. Though, this led to a divide within the gulags, as more opportunities were present for those that assisted the camp guards with their duties. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^chestnyagy]]
- World War 2 led to many gulag prisoners becoming forcibly recruited into the Red Army for defense, which led to further encroachments into the principles of the Воровской мир. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^order227]]
- Upon return, a sizable portion of soldiers that were prisoners of war would be redirected to the gulags, as punishment for either desertion or betrayal. Further reading([Soviet Repressions against former prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_repressions_against_former_prisoners_of_war)) also suggests that many of these prisoners were not given veteran status, and were typically looked down upon. It is still a matter of debate how many were legitimate defectors, or how many were unfairly punished. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^pows]]
- The influx of former soldiers and various ethnic groups into the gulags changed some of the power balance and hierarchies within the camps, as new groups would form that did not strictly adhere to the rudimentary rule system of the вори.
- This led to what is assumed a government supported move against the блатне, or the Traditionalist thieves, and the суки, the 'bitches' or state collaborators. In the span of several years after the war, violence escalated between the groups, with the Traditionalists quickly losing numbers, which was beneficially for the authorities, as they were the anti-state group. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^bitcheswar]]
- In the end, the decade after Stalin's death led to rapid depopulation within the gulags, with many of the first released to be the суки, who still considered themselves to be part of the воровской мир, but also believed in working with the state when it was to their advantage. [[The Vory by Mark Galeotti#^newvory]]

### Chapter 5:
- Rituals were a regular part of initiation into gangs throughout most of the history of Russian crime groups, though the severity of the rituals, and what they signified, changed over time. It's generally believed that much of the change was in the restructuring of the Вори during the 1960s, when they began to move out of the gulag system.
- The notable change that was made with from the move to pre-camp towards camp life, was the formation of a unified code of the Вори, in which there was no proper structure, but an understanding of the "accepted" way of being a respected criminal. This led to various rituals, usually unique to individual camps, which had their own languages of tattoos, slang, and fashion.
- This also extended to rituals and regulations for those who were "accepted" вори within the camps, and how selection for elevated thieves would be initiated and utilized.
- A particular hint towards these is the development of language that came from the gulags, much of which being the appropriation of common words to denote, in slang, more dark and criminal meanings. For example, if a prisoner wanted to escape from a camp in Siberia, they would, often enough, convince another prisoner to join them in their escape, so that they could later kill and eat them to survive the harsh conditions. The word Мясо(*myaso*), meaning meat, started to be used to describe the victims of these schemes.
- While this is typical for any sort of profession(medical terminology/slang, legal terminology/slang, etc.), there was a dual purpose to this changing of language overall: to communicate in such a way as to encode meaning in everyday language, which kept outsiders unaware of the true meaning, and to initiate hopefuls into the criminal underworld, as learning the language was a rite of passage in its own way.
- While criminal slang existed before the introduction of vast prisoner camps, it was often regional or based around a single grouping of criminals. With many criminal elements being suddenly thrust together during the time of gulags, homogenization of criminal language led to new outlooks and utilizations of a more universal system of communicating. Though, much of this began to change in the 1960s, as the gulags were slowly removed, and criminals looked for other avenues to pursue.
- The visual language of tattoos was equally homogenized, especially to denote specific meaning towards other prisoners within the gulag system. It could either be used to denote specific marks of criminal life(prison terms, crimes, etc.), to communicate(signifying occupation or intent), or to punish others(marking an outsider or denoting a slight against the Вори). Though, it's difficult to create a full lexicon, as often the only people who knew the meanings themselves were part of the thieves' world, and they would often refuse to explain to outsiders.
- Various other artifacts were used to denote the separation of the thieves' world from mainstream society. First, there was the naming that would be given newer initiates, that served both to give them a new identity, and to utilize proper codenames for communication. There was also the obsession of games of chance, and the strict adherence to bets made by participants, even up to 3 years of silence. Clothes and accessories would often be used to denote rank between members. Finally, music served as both a metaphor for criminal life, and a way to communicate values and ideas throughout the diaspora.
- The last portion of this to be understood was the role that women would often take within the wider Воровской мир. Given the valuation towards a form of hyper-masculinity, women were often regulated to tools and orifices for male вори. Wives especially were treated as property of the gang, instead of a partner for an individual. Rapes and murders of both wives and female prisoners was not only common, but expected. Some women created gangs of their own, but their small numbers and expected status made them almost ineffectual.

## Part 2 - Emergence:
### Chapter 6:
- The death of Stalin left the Soviet Union in a precarious state, as many of the policies of Stalin brought benefits to some, but devastation to many. The resulting power vacuum left both statesmen and citizens in a bind of figuring out what the new direction of the Soviet Union would become, and often whether to acknowledge or condemn the previous few decades.
- The вори и суки, which had faced off as foes within the gulag system, continued their conflict during the years after the disassembly of the gulags that occurred in the Soviet Union during the 50s and 60s. While originally the вори were originally losing, the changing landscape of Russian political and economic life led to new methods and tactics in the ongoing conflict between criminals and the state.
- Now outside of the gulags, the primary competitor for criminals was the Soviet state, which had military and police power to fight against the incoming wave of released вори. Soon, most of the adherents of the 'thieves code' were run underground, with little to no network like they had within the prison camps. For all intents and purposes, it was believed that the growth of the 'thieves world' was stymied, and that criminal activity was removed from normal society.
- This resulted in the growth of more independent groups, many of which did not adhere to the principles laid down by the older generation of вори. Yet, new economic factors, such as the growth of corrupt statesmen and the black market, gave many of these new groups footholds to operate from. A new relationship began to form, where the Soviet government began to turn a blind eye to the black market as a secondary economic force, as long as it did not disrupt the Soviets overall.
- Much of the corruption started from the Stalin era, but continued well into the 1980s. Often, to fulfill demanding quotas of the Five-Year Plan, politicians and statesmen would accept and deliver bribes and underhanded deals. Over time, many of these turned into de facto principles of statesmen, where the handing over of deals or goods was expected by those in power.
- The battle between enterprising individuals and state ideology often became a game of shadows, where statesmen would often endorse illegal enterprises off-hand, but act within their official capacity on the other hand. While many of the deceptions of these statesmen would utilize state capacities, there was always the threat of being exposed. More underground elements were needed to hide operations.
- To secure goods and production, statesmen would often turn to smugglers and black-market entrepreneurs. This began a more symbiotic relationship between the new wave of criminals and the statesmen that were looking for new markets and avenues of production and distribution. Yet, this also prompted changes within the criminals, who began to learn how to better manipulate and utilize the state apparatuses for their own benefit.

### Chapter 7:
- Many of the reforms of Gorbachev inadvertently gave the criminal elements of Russia more power. Certainly, they were reforms that should, in theory, work for any country that is attempting to move towards a more free economy. Unfortunately, there was already an underbelly of corruption, black markets, and extortion that were too well equipped to pounce on the reforms than a proper system to fight back against them.
- The first major reform that backfired was the focus on reducing alcoholic consumption, which had much the same effect as Prohibition in the United States. Part of this was that the вори, who already had illegal networks of production and distribution in place, suddenly had much more demand for their services. This produced a reciprocal relationship between the Russian citizen, who had been used to drinking, and the only people who could supply a now more controlled substance.
- There was also Gorbachev's attempt to open the market a bit by allowing private business Co-ops, which were typically abused by early adopters to make a quick buck. Criminals also seized the opportunity, often starting racketeering rings around the new businesses, and offering various services that couldn't be found elsewhere, such as smuggling supplies or ruining competition. Over time, this gave criminals more access to legitimate markets, which led to further entrenchment in Russian economic and political life.
- In addition, the era brought about newcomers to the criminal scene. Sportsmen, mainly those in gymnastics or martial arts, saw new opportunities arise when funding for sports programs started to decrease. They would often be involved in protection rackets and act as muscle. Similarly, the афганцы(*afgantsy*) came back from war and were largely dropped to the side by the Russian government, due to various reasons. Some took up advocacy or starting their own gyms, while others found new opportunities among the growing criminal elements.
- In summation, the growth of criminal elements within Russia accelerated within the 1970s and 1980s, mostly due to the confluence of several factors. First, the curbing of alcohol, a staple in Russian daily life, led to the introduction of the average person to criminals, many of which formed rather beneficial relationships. The opening up of private business allowed criminal elements new avenues of bolstering their entrenchment in Russian society. The introduction of newcomers to the criminal world, especially skilled individuals with martial or war experience, bolstered the numbers and capabilities of growing criminal enterprises.

### Chapter 8:
- Through the 1990s, as the Russian government attempted to transition to a liberal economic state, criminal elements were suddenly on a much more even playing field. The dissolution and privatization of many state assets allowed for gangs to acquire legitimate trade deals, which would often front their criminal goals. Also, the sudden shift in funding, especially the lack of funding, for many legal structures, including the police and the courts, incentivized citizens to turn to criminal organizations, who had the capability to enforce their own sense of law.
- There was also the new cutthroat style of capitalism that emerged during the 90s, as a sudden loosening of the regulations led many to treat markets as a means to an end, with increasing capital and resources as their main objective.
- Many of the first sectors to turn to organized crime were in the business sector, who needed protection and dispute handling from a structure that could follow through with both enforcement and swift judgement. With the courts defanged, gangs became the primary provider of these services.
- There also grew the concept of the "honest gangster". While the image came from previous generations of вори, the security offered by the gang's code meant some sense of stability during the rocky economic reality of Russia. Gangs were still highly violent and ruthless, but they made a point of honesty with their intentions and emphasized staying true to one's word, either positively or negatively.
- While there were some who did not operate under the premise of an "honest gangster", the organizations that grew tremendously in size, scope, and capabilities were often those who adopted general business practices. In some way, criminals adopted less militaristic standpoints and strategies, and turned to a more corporate and businesslike structure, complete with contracting and financial accounting.
- When power transferred to Putin in 1999, new policies further entrenched these elements into the state apparatus. On it's face, Putin's policy was a crackdown on criminal elements and corrupt officials. Behind the scenes, however, more leeway was given to those organizations that cooperated with state elements. The general principle of Putin's early tenure was that the state was in power, and all other elements would pay primacy to the state rather than their own interests. While there was some friction, this proved to be beneficial to the changing criminal underworld, as they were generally left alone if they managed to cut the state a portion of their profits.
- In turn, this gave rise to the авторитет(*avtoritet* or authority) class of criminals, who essentially operated as criminal businessmen. They would have legal businesses and economic interests, while skimming funds off for more illegitimate enterprises, such as smuggling, counterfeiting, or extortion. By the 2000s, the normal operations of the criminal underworld became the new form of Russian oligarchic criminal.

## Part 3 - Varieties:
### Chapter 9:
- The majority of Russian criminal networks are not strictly hierarchical structures in the same way that the Italian mafia or Japanese yakuza would be. It's more a loose network, with some smaller groups forming surrounding various common interests, territories. Some have clear leaders, while others do not. In a way, much of it is closer to a business structure, where higher ups constitute power, but more in the capacity of managerial style than traditional hierarchical structures.
- One of the effects of this is that there isn't a strict territory, such a neighborhood or street, that one could point towards in order to define what counts as being part of the Russian mob. Rather, you'd have to point to the social and financial networks, which are much more fluid and difficult to track and contain.
- Galeotti references [Page 24 of this UN study](https://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/publications/Pilot_survey.pdf) to denote how organized crime groups are classified by structures. The rest of this chapter will be examples of each of these structure types appear within Russian criminal groups.
- Often, the most strict hierarchical gangs can be found within very small units, typically serving one specific function within the wider criminal network. The largest one to keep such a structure were the Uralmash, which started as a regionally based criminal-group that grew in power and influence during the 90s. Yet, Putin's campaign to remove obvious criminal activity forced them to shift to a more subtle form of hierarchy. The group now operates more like a business club, where owners of variously connected interests will coordinate with each other on policy.
- In the Eastern portions of Russia, more regionally-based groups formed. Historically, the region, as it was so far away from the ruling cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, were far more anarchistic in their structure, with most gangs keeping small pockets of territory, and were usually tied into the power structures of their area. Over time, with the rise of criminal activity overall, the Far Eastern Association of Thieves emerged, which acted like a trade association for the disconnected gangs. They were also able to establish connections with criminal networks that were emerging from China, which gave them a foothold against the interests of Western groups. Yet, Chinese influence grew, and most of European Russia started to recede interest from the region, leading to the overall loss of the Association. These days, the region is Russian in name and association, but most of the activity in the region is now under control of Chinese criminal networks.
- Clustered hierarchies, what the study calls a Hierarchical Conglomerate, are mostly found within the various groups that are attempting to achieve a specific goal. For example, roughly 30 percent of world heroin trafficking flow goes through Russia from Afghanistan, which then funnels it both East towards Chinese markets and West towards European markets. These routes are a smattering of various regional or territorial groups that have created a robust network of de-facto trade routes. Russian groups, among the largest within the network, often attempt to expand their influence, usually through lateral integration of more production, though stability to the overall network tends to limit how violent these attempts are. The majority of local heroin distribution, for example, is quite tame, as it's a collection of smaller gangs that are essentially paid in their share of drugs to distribute. Thus, economic competition is favored over aggressive territorial grabs.
- In many ways, this demonstrates the sort of 'corporatizing' of drug markets that began in the late 1980s. In this case, there are several branches of drug production, such as opium farming/harvesting, opium shipping, heroin production, then shipping, and finally distribution. Different portions of the chain are handled by connected but separate groups, which mirrors the corporate structure of subletting factories and hiring management staff for each. The heroin acts as both product and stock in the overall trade, with many of the routes substantiated over long-term relationships that are formed among many of the different groups. Reputation plays primacy here, as one needs to be able to back up their portion of the chain. Any disruption, such as seizure by the police, harms those further down the chain, and considerable work is needed to repair the relationship.
- Core group hierarchies are somewhat rare in Russia today, but the Tambovskaya(Tambov) group in St. Petersburg was the largest and most notable. Starting in the late 1980s, it rapidly grew until 1993, where it was restructured to fit a more business oriented world. It sought out contracts with businesses, both to give the group footholds within the legitimate market, but also to serve as fronts. This could include security companies, energy production, and transportation. Many of these moves also placed higher group members into the circles of politicians and large business owners, giving them further access to resources and connections.
- The shift to more aggressive crackdowns on criminal activity, as well as the reputation for St. Petersburg to be secretly run by the Tambov group, led to another restructuring. The core group started to separate out various sectors to their own operations, with the core group acting more like a board of directors, typically from outside the country. For the most part, it is a loose connection of operations that follows directives. As this is all fairly recent, it's somewhat of a question in how this will fare in the future.
- Finally, there is the criminal network, of which the most successful have been within and surrounding Moscow. While this started much like the Tambov group in St. Petersburg, it quickly became more of a criminal network of loosely associated groups that wished to operate in the area. Notably, any attempt to gain control over the group is often met with severe resistance. In a way, the structure is more akin to a smattering of local businesses, all of which have their particular clientele and markets that they compete in. The largest contributor to the system staying in place are the introduction of arbitration groups, which helped to settle disputes between groups on the basis of their reputation. These groups, such as Solntsevo, provided services for criminal enterprises, but also legitimate businesses during times when the court became backed-up and difficult to rely on. As such, much of the power structure within these networks is denoted by who could be trusted to properly arbitrate for others.

### Chapter 10:
- The first part of this chapter is focused on the story of a man who the author is calling Borz, who was a Chechen contract killer who operated in Moscow. While there are pieces of historical data, it is mostly focused Borz' experience, especially within the criminal world.
- Chechens hold a special place within the criminal underworld of Russia, as they carry a particular reputation, and are often fiercely loyal to one another. In some sense, they are essentially their own franchise of criminals, more centered around a particular subculture than a strict code or organization.
- One of the artifacts that came from Chechen national identity is the concept of the *abreg*, which was akin to the Western sense of Robin Hood, who engaged in banditry for chivalrous or moral reasons. Given the repeated history of Chechen resistance to Russian control, the identity became somewhat tied with the concept of the freedom fighter, which also informed Chechen criminals.
- Russia would often claim during its conflicts in Chechnya that it was fighting a 'gangster regime'. This was, in some sense, true, as various local gangs had established themselves in power structures within the region. Yet, there was also a wide Chechen diaspora that were disconnected from those groups. It was cheekily called the "two Chechnyas". One which was based within the Chechen region, and one that operated outside.
- In the groups that operate in Russia, there is no overarching structure of Chechen gangs. Rather, there is what is known as the *bratva*, which is more a cultural connection between Chechen gangs, which appeals towards shared heritage and the moral authority of *abreg*.
- While Chechens enjoyed some early success in Moscow, the rise of Slavic gangs began to push out the Chechens from the region. In addition, the Russian invasion of Chechnya led much of the police force to view Chechen criminals as potential sources of political unrest, which they mostly left alone until they felt safe enough to stop a potential insurgency.
- Much of the Chechen criminal network has become a niche market, but one that holds a certain mythology to it. They are generally considered to be the most honorable, but most ruthless groups of criminals. As such, they are often considered 'the protection racketeers protection racketeer'. To even be associated with a Chechen group is often enough to bolster the idea of a gang's capability to follow through on any promises made.
- One of the results of the Second Chechen War was the installation of Ramzan Kadyrov as the head of the Chechen state. In many cases, this has created a brutal regime, which regularly disposes of political enemies, and embezzles funding for personal gain. While none of it is ideal, another war would be devastating.
- In a way, Galeotti states, there are still two Chechnyas: The state of Chechnya, which runs its own form of a criminal empire, blessed by the Russian government, and the Chechen diaspora, who have created their own sense of identity within Russia, often leaking over into criminal life.

### Chapter 11:
- Georgians make up a fairly large proportion of the Russian criminal network, with some estimates putting them up to half of the controlling leaders within the country. While Russians will attribute this to overwhelming violence, it appears it is more an effect of the Georgians focus on deal-making and being business minded.
- Very early on in the career of Georgian criminals, they sought to entangle themselves within the political sphere of Georgian life. Dzhaba Ioseliani was especially well known for establishing ties with various politicians, including several presidents, and establishing militia organizations. When the Georgian state attempted to crackdown on these elements, many decided to flee to Russia.
- One of the more notorious groups of Georgians is headed by Tariel Oniani, who proved to be a cunning and ruthless provocateur within the relatively stable Russian criminal underworld. He would push for more aggression, and would often instigate other groups, then ignore any possible arbitration. In 2010, he was arrested and sentenced to jail. Still, he receives visitors and contacts people through video chat, meaning he still operates today, though usually at a distance, through his fiercely loyal inner circle.
- In contrast to this Aslan Usoyan, also known as Grandfather Hassan. His main strengths were in management of coffers, brokering deals between various ethnic groups, and learning to restructure as needed. For example, he had been given control of a common *obshchak*(общак), which were the pooled funds of several groups for business and emergency needs. A rival, 'Rudik', accused Usoyan of embezzling and mismanaging funds in 1998, during the financial crisis where the ruble was devalued. Disgraced, Usoyan managed to crawl back into prominence by becoming an arbitrator between the Russians, Georgians, Armenians, and so on. Eventually, he was assassinated in 2013, which left his holdings to several family members that he had been training.
- There was also the rise of Rovshan Dzhaniyev, an Azeri(a person from Azerbaijan) who got his start in Abkhazia, a smaller region in Georgia. Dzhaniyev's appeal, especially to the younger generation, was his stereotypical approach to gang life, in which violence was the preferred negotiating method. While unsuitable to the current regime of Russian criminal life, it found favor among those who felt like the business aesthetic of Russian crime was not what they preferred. He was eventually killed in Turkey in 2016.

### Chapter 12:
- International Russian crime is an increasingly difficult phenomenon to properly categorize or understand. While most primarily think of these organizations as either ethnically Russian or just Russian-speaking, the truth is that the adoption of many into the structure of organized crime generally reaches beyond ethnic, linguistic, or cultural lines. Most often, the Russians act as business partners, typically as facilitators for supplies or connections that benefits the other party, for a hefty fee. It's not the makeup of the group that Russians have exported to the wider criminal world, but rather a unique structure and ethic to criminal life.
- Within many of the post-Soviet states, there are typically two kinds of local criminal scenes: those with a robust criminal underground, often connected to the local power structure, and those that are more fractured, often in nations with little national power of their own. Russians crime networks have learned to deal with both, usually to provide access to supplies that may be needed by local gangs. While Russian gangs do have the power to muscle into some of the territory, most have found it to be far more beneficial to act as business partners, often giving local groups access to the transnational markets, such as routes into the international heroin trade.
- Though, there was also an initial wave of Russian crime networks worming their way into more volatile territories, such as the Baltics. With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that this was more to give Russian criminals a potential escape route during the relative uncertainty of the late 1990s. Over time, however, most Russian criminals did not seek to maintain these footholds for long, and concerted effort by local communities, often seeing the Russian criminals as a potential precursor to invasion, began to push the Russians out.
- Initial footholds in the US, usually 'Little Odessa', faced similar problems. They established quickly, mostly stuck to securing a network in the new local environment, and were quickly ousted by local enforcement due to fears of a global Russian Mafia.
- As time went on, tactics shifted towards the previously mentioned model. Russians, instead of securing gang-havens of their own, would instead seek to fill gaps in the local market. Illicit services, such as access to wide money-laundering networks, bootleg goods, fraud networks, and so on, were the mainstays of the second wave of Russian outgrowth. In this capacity, the new global Russian criminal networks, much like they did in post-Soviet states, sought to create beneficial relationships with local gangs, supplanting themselves as useful business partners more than their own group or identity.
- Overall, the global trends of Russian groups going transnational appear to align with similar groups attempting to similarly turn towards global markets. What makes the Russians unique is the particular strategies that they have implemented to achieve this end, and how successful they have been in establishing networks in areas that other groups may struggle with. Though, this requires understanding that what we typically call the "Russian mafia" is still largely within Russia itself, with some footholds in the wider Eurasian territory. Most of the transnational connections do not have the ethnic, linguistic, or cultural makings of a "Russian mafia", but more exist as external networks created to further increase profits in a new global economy.

## Part 4 - Future:
### Chapter 13:
- Now examining the policies of the Putin era of Russia, we can start to see the modern understanding of crime in Russia. Specifically, Putin makes a big show of rooting out corruption, or of eliminating crime, but this does not reflect in reality.
- Much of the model of crime, as noted previously, has begun to accept a more homogenized form of enterprising business, in which criminal networks provide services that are either illegal(bootlegging, smuggling, etc.) or semi-legal(protection, arbitration, etc.).
- Most of the relationship between the state and crime is now that of a symbiotic relationship. One doesn't control the other, but has rather figured out how to co-exist while gaining benefits from each other. Criminal networks are allowed to do what they wish, as long as it does not actively harm the reputation or resources of the state, with those assisting state actors getting more leeway.
- Clashes between the Russian state and Russian crime do still happen, often because a major player has either fallen out of favor with the Kremlin, or because a criminal group has begun to push the boundaries.
- As such, there is often difficulty in mapping out the full criminal network within Russia, or even understand how that network properly connects to state apparatuses or actors. Sometimes, you'll even have people working for legitimate business, and have no idea that the business also works as a front for criminal activity.
- An effect of these changes is the overall loss of the old вори culture. Crime is just seen as business now, with almost none of the original traits of the 'honest gangster' or 'thief in code'. Yet, Galeotti argues, it isn't that the воровской мир disappeared. Rather, it became the norm, with most of Russian society now adopting ideas, traditions, and strategies from the previous generations.

### Chapter 14:
- The first portion tells the tale of Rovshan Dzhaniyev in more detail, specifying how his rise to power and contribution to the criminal underworld was a bit of an anomaly. For the most part, he did not seek to create political and economic connections like many of his competitors, but he was far more willing to act out violently. This gained him some notoriety and fame among various disgruntled бандиты, as they felt out of place in the new economic models that the Russian criminal networks had created. But, this also made him unable to deal with changing economic conditions, and without enough assets to bolster his strength. By the end of 2016, Dzhaniyev was dead, and his gang had dwindled into almost nothing.
- Over the course of several financial crises faced by Russia during the 21st century(2008 and 2014), the criminal underworlds, much like their legitimate counterparts, faced severe restructuring. Some gangs, many of which didn't have good access to resources or markets, might dissolve or be integrated into another group to recoup potential losses. Others, often those who had connections to more stable markets or services, found ways to benefit from the economic downturn. Often though, this meant that they became more deeply entrenched within social and political circles, which would prove to be a problem later.
- An example is given with a gangster called Dvornik, who ran several local brothels in a Moscow neighborhood called Kapotnya. During the economic downturn of 2014, his capability to pay his men, bribe the police, and afford his own high-end lifestyle turned into an impossibility. He was eventually jailed, and much of his territory was absorbed by a man named Rak, who had connections to the wider network ran by Oniani.
- Gangs that had existing ties outside of Russian markets proved especially resilient, though it required quick restructuring and making new deals. An example is given of a gangster called Pyotr Banana, who had existing ties to Belarusian gangs, that got into smuggling foodstuffs in 2014 during Putin's sanctions. This required setting up new connections and deals with other gangs. It is unknown how the relationship will develop from here.
- Several possible routes have been identified for growth among several criminal markets. The Olympic games offered a very lucrative deal for both legitimate and illegitimate business. Putin's ban on gambling has driven much of the market underground, and the planned casinos have become hotbeds of territory grabs.
- There is also the disproportionate amount of cybercrime that has risen from Russia in the past two decades, mostly driven by those who teach themselves and others to use computers. While there is a growing legitimate market for technology within Russia, the opportunities for cybercrime drive a decent number of the computer literate to criminal enterprises. For the most part though, they are not embedded within the existing criminal networks. They appear to operate more as freelancers, who can be hired for certain tasks required.
- As it is, at the time Galeotti wrote the book in 2017, many of the elements within the criminal underworld are quite precarious. Yes, there is a diverse network that has a vested interest in keeping the peace, but there are plenty of elements and economic pressures that could tip the scales towards violence. In 2017, the status quo is that the state is the most powerful entity, and that power keeps everything in line for the time. Yet, if there is another economic crisis, a major death, or a hasty power move, then much of that could tumble down. It's more the uncertainty of how the criminal underworld will react than any assurances. 

### Chapter 15:
- The connection between state actors and criminal elements is incredibly difficult to parse out in the current landscape of Russia. Sometimes there are situations where the actions of the state appear to directly benefit the criminals, and vice-versa. Whether these effects were intentional or not is near impossible to know for certain. Yet, the regular occurrence of the symbiosis implies that there is some coordination happening at some level.
- Of recent examples, the Russian move into taking the Crimean peninsula had all the hallmarks of a coordination between Kremlin forces, local crime units, and local politicians that had supposed ties to both. Russia's deployment of the 'little green men'(зелоные человеки) appeared to coincide with a temporary ceasefire of local gangs, who took the opportunity to seize assets and property that were both politically and economically advantageous. There was also the growing rumor that Odessa was becoming a rival port city to Sevastopol, both for the Russian economy and smuggling operations.
- Following the Crimean invasion, there was the effort by Russia to instigate nationalist movements in Eastern Ukraine, which proved effective in the Donbas and Lugansk regions. While not explicitly directed at criminal forces, the momentum was quickly seized by criminals within the region looking for outside funding and support. Over time, embezzlement became a real problem for the Russians.
- As the book was written in 2017, this was before Russia itself became involved in the overall operations. While they've given their excuses why, it could be that the overall cost of sending their own troops was lesser than continuing to supply criminal enterprises, though that is simply speculation on my part.
- Then, there are the generally extrajudicial actions that criminal networks will sometimes take which appear to benefit the Kremlin almost entirely. Primarily, due to the broad group of underground Russian hackers, many cyberattacks that benefit the Kremlin are likely paid for as a service to the state. There are also cases of several people of interest being able to escape authorities through what are typically smuggling operations. Finally, politically motivated assassinations can sometimes come from people with a heavy Russian criminal background, but which does not have any connection to the assassination target.
- Though, there is a worry that the overreliance of criminal enterprises may come back to bite the Kremlin. Criminal networks, almost everywhere in the world, are usually quite adaptable to new conditions, and their strategies can morph very quickly. If the Kremlin leans on Russian crime too much, then could it possibly turn into the favor of the criminal networks, who then overturn the state as the dominant force of the nation?

### Chapter 16:
- The diffusion of criminal slang into mainstream culture denotes the level of influence that Russian crime, and especially the воровской мир, has had on Russian culture overall. It especially hints how accepting the wider social tapestry has adopted ideas from Russian criminals.
- Then, the depiction of gangsters within several forms of media, starting with novels and ending in TV shows, matches much of the evolution that Russian criminals similarly underwent. Personally, the mention of the difference between Брат and Брат 2 was especially noteworthy, as I've seen the first, and have debated whether to see the second. Now I want to, just to see the contrast.
- Another outpouring was in the adoption and transformation of the *shanson*, which is a genre of music inspired by those which came from the gulags and early criminal enterprises. While they got their inspiration from criminal life, it is not a direct connection, but more an interpretation of criminal life as sung by the mainstream.
- Overall, Russia is not in a good position to fight against the wide criminal networks that have dug in for so long. Corruption at both the top and bottom have sapped hope out of many citizens, and there is not enough momentum to properly change the situation. Yet, there is a growing sentiment that citizens are unhappy with the overall endeavor, and there are sections of various institutions that are attempting to do what they can. It is possible for Russia to turn itself around, but it's a big question of how.
- There is also the possibility for other nations to place pressure on these networks from the outside, mostly by rooting out any sort of outreach or foothold that is achieved outside of Russia. While the political situation doesn't allow us to interfere with Russia's politics, sending many of these elements back puts pressure on Russia to fix the problems at home, instead of trying to let out pressure by continuing to leak their criminal networks.
- Overall, though, there may be a sense of pessimism when it comes to Russia and crime. Yet, there are those who hold an optimism that Russia will eventually learn to fix these problems, and that more stability will be achieved, both nationally and internationally.
# Notable Quotes:
## Part 1 - Foundations:
### Chapter 1:

>Instead, order in the village was largely the preserve of *samosud* (‘self-judging’), a surprisingly nuanced form of lynch law, whereby the members of the commune applied their own moral code to offenders, regardless or even in defiance of the state’s laws. This has been best studied by Cathy Frierson, who concluded that – contrary to the opinions of many police and state officials of the time – it was not mindless violence but a process with its own logic and its own principles.
>-Page 14

>The Russian language contains two very distinct words for crime: *prestupleniye*, an essentially technical definition, a breach of the law, and *zlodeyanie*, which carries with it a moral judgement.32 Tellingly, the peasant proverb had it that ‘God punishes sins, and the state punishes guilt’. Such poaching may have been *prestupleniye*, but the peasants certainly did not see it as *zlodeyanie* because the landlord had more than enough wood for his personal needs, and ‘God grew the forest for everyone’. It could even be interpreted as an act of social banditry, a petty redistribution of wealth from the exploiter to the exploited. In the eyes of the eighteenth-century traveller the Marquis de Custine, the serfs had to be ‘on guard against their masters, who \[were\] constantly acting towards them with open and shameless bad faith’, and so they in turn would ‘compensate themselves by artifice what they suffer through injustice’.
>-Page 16

### Chapter 2:

>The urban gangster was a product of the slums of a rapidly urbanising late-tsarist Russia, the so-called yamy, where life was cheap and miserable. It was in the drinking dens and dosshouses of the yamy that the subculture of the vorovskoi mir emerged, the ‘thieves’ world’. Its code, of separation from and contempt for mainstream society and its values – nation, church, family, charity – became one of the few unifying forces within this milieu, and would become a central part of the macho beliefs of the twentieth-century Russian vory. It was not that the criminals had no codes or values, but rather that they picked, chose and invented them as best suited their needs.
>-Page 22

>‘Mishka Yaponchik’ – his real name was Mikhail Vinnitsky – was a particular such legend in his own lifetime. The son of a carter, given his nickname ‘the Japanese’ apparently for his bony face and dark, slanted eyes, he was an ambitious and audacious gangster from an early age, with the charisma to attract others of the same mould to his side. He soon acquired a formidable reputation in Odessa and the police would reportedly turn a blind eye so long as he avoided them and left the neighbourhoods of the rich be. As he rose to become the foremost mobster of the city, he became rich on tributes from other gangs and extorted from businesses. He made no efforts to hide this status, promenading through the most fashionable haunts in a dandyish cream-coloured suit, bow tie and straw boater, always accompanied by his bodyguards. He would hold court in Café Fankoni, where a table was always reserved for him, alongside the city’s other successful businessmen. From time to time, like any magnanimous monarch, he would hold street parties, with tin buckets of vodka and tables of free food. ‘Yaponchik’ would end up a casualty of the post-revolutionary civil war, killed in Voznesensk in 1920, but for five years the so-called ‘King of the Moldavanka’ would stand as a symbol of the Odessan gangster made good.

### Chapter 3:

>Stalin does not seem to have been a triggerman or safecracker himself, but rather a fixer who found common cause with ‘thieves’ in it for the money, not (or at least not only) for the ideology. In 1907, for example, he organised the ambush of a stagecoach carrying cash to the Imperial Bank in Tbilisi, in which almost forty people died under a hail of gunfire and improvised grenades. The gangsters fled with a third of a million rubles, although most of this haul ended up unusable because it was in large-denomination notes whose serial numbers were quickly circulated throughout Europe. The actual rough stuff was in the hands of a ruthless Armenian, Simon Ter-Petrossian, known as ‘Kamo’, who already had his own gang and was as much a *vor* as a revolutionary.

>By identifying the rich and the petty criminal as the enemies of socialism, Lenin was implicitly exempting the not-so-petty criminal, making him a potential ally. This was just one of the compromises made during the civil war that would shape the rest of the Soviet era. Although the new government adopted draconian policies – the Military Revolutionary Committee warned that ‘at the first attempt by dark elements to cause confusion, robbery, bloodshed or shooting on the streets of Petrograd, the criminal responsible will be wiped off the face of the earth’ – in practice ‘confusion, robbery, bloodshed or shooting’ abounded. In 1918, robberies and murders were at ten to fifteen times the prewar level and Lenin himself was not immune to the lawlessness of the period.
>Page 38 ^LeninCriminal

>The phenomenon of *besprizornost* would survive through the 1920s, and bring with it the associated challenges of begging, theft and even violence. Tales abounded – sometimes exaggerated, but sadly too often accurate – of gangs of teenagers or even younger children not only engaging in petty theft but mobbing and sometimes killing victims in gangs ten, twenty, thirty strong. Joseph Douillet, the last Belgian consul to the prewar USSR, witnessed the endgame to a rising in the Persianovka children’s camp, where some twenty-five youths from Novocherkassk armed themselves with knives and guns and took the camp, holding it for almost a week before soldiers came to restore order.
>-Page 40 ^YouthViolence

>Through this constant mingling of criminals from across the Soviet Union, the *vorovskoi mir* became ever more homogeneous and interconnected, a veritable ‘gangster archipelago’. In the process, the camp system strengthened and transmitted this distinctive subculture, at once enforcing and teaching underworld orthodoxy. Thus, for example, Vyatlag camp was described in its own prison newspaper, *Za zheleznoi reshyotkoi* (‘Behind Iron Bars’), as ‘a real school’ offering ‘courses of the second stage of moral training for future skilled, “stylish” criminals’. This was not just about indoctrinating criminals into a common culture, it was also about the communication of professional skills. In its own vicious way, the Stalin regime was bringing about rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and, as during late tsarism, this generated increased specialisation and stratification within the underworld, just as for the rest of society. Such professional classifiers ranged from the *farmazonshiki*, counterfeit-currency dealers (who would also often palm *kukly*, ‘dolls’, onto unwitting marks: a bundle of fake notes or even just scrap paper, with real notes at the top and bottom to fool the eye), to the *gonsha* (‘shoe’), a pickpocket working the crowded buses and trams at rush hour.
>-Page 45 ^GulagVorovskoiMir

>The key point is that the camp system was the crucible in which the loose vorovskoi mir that had emerged in late nineteenth-century Russia would not only become increasingly homogeneous, including embracing non-Slavic nationalities, but also acquire what it had always lacked, some kind of hierarchy. The dog-eat-dog struggle for daily survival in the Gulags, summar-ised in the precept ‘you die today, and I’ll die tomorrow’, only deepened the cultural ties amongst the blatnye, and the gulf between them and the rest of society.
>-Page 47

### Chapter 4:

>Just as Stalin’s policies unified the vorovskoi mir on one level, they also divided it on another, creating a new body of collaborators, the so-called suki (‘bitches’), who were willing to help the state run the Gulags, but only in their own interests. The challenge for the Stalinist state was how best to manage the massive influx of convicts, and to do so cheaply and efficiently. While the primary initial motivation of the purges and the mass incarcerations was political, the state also sought to exploit this virtually enslaved workforce for economic gain. As a Polish-born zek, Gustav Herling, put it, ‘the whole system of forced labour in Soviet Russia – in all its stages, the interrogations and hearings, the preliminary imprisonment, and the camp itself – is intended primarily not to punish the criminal, but rather to exploit him economically and transform him psychologically’.
>-Page 51

>Nonetheless, especially by the later 1930s, even members of the vorovskoi mir became tempted by the opportunities of collaboration. The traditionalists within the vorovskoi mir despised these quislings. They became outcasts, the otoshedshie (‘departed’), more commonly and vitriolically known as suki (‘bitches’). Their lives were forfeit in the eyes of the blatnye, who increasingly also called themselves chestnyagy, ‘the unconverted’.
>-Page 52 ^chestnyagy

>People’s Defence Committee Order No. 227, issued following the disaster that was the decimation of the Soviet defensive line in the initial German onslaught, envisaged that hundreds of thousands of convicts would be rushed to penal battalions, originally punishment units for deserters and malcontents. In the first three years of the war, almost a million Gulag inmates were transferred into the Red Army.
>-Page 54 ^order227

>The vory and regular criminals who had served in the army and were now considered to have broken their code were joined by maybe half a million former soldiers and partisans whose ‘crime’ had been to be captured by the enemy when Stalin expected – demanded – that they fight to the death. For them, ‘liberation’ meant an inglorious transfer from a foreign prison camp to a Soviet one. Over a third of a million Red Army soldiers ended up in the NKVD’s ‘verification and filtration camps’, and while most were eventually freed to civilian life or returned into the military, at least a third of them ended up in the Gulag.
>-Page 54 ^pows

>Increasingly, camp authorities actively began to seek to convert or break the traditionalists. Varlam Shalamov, for example, recounted the tale he had heard in 1948, of convicts arriving at Vanino transit prison forced to strip, so that the thieves could be identified by their tattoos.21 They were offered the choice between ritually forsaking their code and death, with many choosing the latter. It is unclear if this actually happened, or whether it was just one of the myths that circulate in any information-scarce society, but the authorities certainly did use the blatnye’s own customs against them, not least identifying them by their ink. They also demanded that traditionalists publicly recant their old ways, by carrying out some symbolic act of labour (such as raking the forbidden zone between fences, which was kept cleared to show footprints), locking the door of a barracks, and sitting and eating with other collaborators. That way, they were irredeemably ‘departed’ from the blatnoi community, and could not go back.
>-Page 57

>In terms of the big picture, the collaborators won, for a variety of reasons. They often had numbers on their side, and the ex-soldiers brought with them military experience: the blatnye might be tough individually, but so were their enemies, and many of them were used to fighting as units. Perhaps most importantly, the suki had the support of the regime. The authorities found a variety of ways to tilt the balance, whether by allowing them to dominate camp careers such as cook and barber – which meant knives and razors – or by giving them access to work tools such as axes and shovels. They could also move groups of prisoners like armies in the field, concentrating them in individual camps until they had wiped out the blatnye there, and then moving them on to the next.
>-Page 58 ^bitcheswar

>So the suki had won, albeit at the cost of playing their part in rendering the Gulags virtually ungovernable. Nonetheless, win they did, and reshaped the vorovskoi mir in their own image. They retained most of the code, and the culture of brazen and merciless dog-eat-dog predation, but they rewrote the prohibition on collaboration with the state. It now became permissible, so long as it was in the criminal’s interest. When the Gulags were opened, these collaborator-criminals were amongst the first to be released, and over the following decade they would impose their own vision of the code across the Soviet underworld, by threat, persuasion and violence. The way would be open for a new generation of vory to collaborate with dishonest Party functionaries when they felt it was in their interests. This was Stalin’s toxic legacy to the Soviet Union.

# Outside Information
This is primarily a fictional tale that takes a large amount of inspiration from Tolstoy's early life within the Caucasus, making it a semi-autobiographical tale.

To be read with the understanding that it is a subjective perspective, which can help flesh out historical knowledge, but not a good source by itself.

- General thought about the difference between "smart" and "intelligent"
	- Almost everyone is intelligent. They use some form of reasoning and logic to formulate patterns regarding themselves and the world around them. The only people who would fit outside of this would be generally those who experience severe cognitive impairment.
	- Yet, most people are not "smart". This is generally due to several issues that appear to me universally a problem for people, and which I find to be difficult to unwind.
	- First, there is the general paradigm that people formulate the facts around them to fit their particular models. In the social media landscape, we tend to see this as the "alternative facts" landscape of media consumption. While this is a good explanation, there is something more fundamental.
	- Prior ideas are more preferred than later ideas. There are multiple reasons for this:
		- They make a more immediate impression, and therefore are more stringent in our reasoning
		- We tend to build around these ideas before possible alternatives arise, meaning that there is a network of ideas that is already built.
		- A single idea is easier to dismiss than a network of ideas.
	- Second, there is the bi-directional building of ideas that occurs when they exist long enough. They don't just become models in which we describe the world, but also paradigms in which we situate the idea of the self, usually as either participant, observer, or antagonist.

#### Notes:
- Movie opens with a rap battle, which is apparently some college event. Cyril is wearing some golden mask to hide his face, and has made it to the finals. He's coming across as fairly nervous, until the ryhmes start.
- Of course Cyril wins, but runs off before they ask him to remove his mask.
- Apparently he's still in Secondary School, so he was a kid at an adult's tourney.
- The parents make it oddly sexual from the beginning.
- Cyril says "What friends?" when he's told that his friends are going on a school trip. Usually there's at least one person who is Cyrano's friend, so that seems odd.
- Mother just handed him a condom. and is now putting it on a fucking banana, and sucks it. Fucking what?
- First mention of the nose being a problem for his ego
- Everyone on the bus seems to have a nose joke lined up. 
- Overall, this version seems to be more passive, and Cyril is just an angsty kid so far. No panache
- Rebellious kid, must be Roxanne.
- And it immediately gets sexual again. Everyone is talking about some closet.
- Guitar kid has been getting some focus
- Roxanne is quite outgoing
- And now the whole bus is just chanting Pissen. High class
- Benno seems like a charmer.
- Seriously, everyone seems insufferable.
- And we've met our third: Guitar kid. Rick. Nickname Mr. Valium
- Cyril and Roxy pair up for the trip.
- Rick and Cyril are in the same room, guess we have our Cyrano and Christian.
- Well, Cyril is a reader alright. Salinger, David Foster Wallace, Camus, Frisch.
- Ah, the mask was in the bag, and Roxy just saw Rick put it on out of curiousity. Guess we know how this is going to play out. Seems we're going more the "confused identities" route than the deception route.
- Yep, she says that Rick is just misunderstood when Cyril says that he's slow. She's going to confuse Rick and Cyril.
- This dude can't handle any sort of attention. Just where is the Panache?
- Well, we're getting another rap battle in the mask. Roxy is watching, and she hasn't seen Rick. Is she about to be Clark Kent'd?
- Well, don't really know German, but you can definitely hear how the cadence gets dropped by the opponent.
- Oh my god, she actually thought it was Rick. That's just stupid. And now she's jumping in to rap herself. It's going to turn out that she's good.
- Yep, she won. And Cyril just fell in love. With trippy ass dream physics.
- And now the other roommate is talking about committing a crime of uploading pornographic material without consent.
- I'm actually getting quite annoyed at just how passive Cyril is. Cyrano wasn't loved by all, mostly because he liked to make enemies, but his enemies at least knew to take him seriously. This version is going the route of "poor kid with a secret talent" rather than anything that made Cyrano great.
- The movie is trying to make these kids unlikable as possible. and now there's a dance number in a museum to a remixed version of classical music. Barf
- And of course, Rick is bad at poetry, and dumb. Really fucking dumb. Why is that the case every freaking time.
- Well, he's the one to suggest the letter writing. Good start.
- And now Rick doesn't even have music talent.
- Well, it's a hip-hop piece instead of a letter.
- And now it's texts.
- Okay, they made Rick barely functional as a person, not just dumb.
- And sudden third story where the teachers are hooking up? What is going on?
- I'm honestly becoming bored with this version. Usually, other versions add something unique. I suppose the Hip-Hop aspect is something, but it alone is surrounded by some of the most boring versions of these characters I've dealt with.
- I wonder if we will ever get payoff for some of the hinted problems with Roxy. She was crying on the roof earlier in the film, and it was hinted that there was some story as to why she got kicked out of boarding school.
- I just realized that the only aspect to this film is the romance. We haven't once gotten a scene like in the original, "No thank you!"
- There's a random dude who just says, "I'm from New York" in English. And Rick actually said a funny line, even if he didn't mean to.
- And apparently we're adding in that Rick can't dance. At least I can relate to that, lol
- Did he just fucking bite her nose? The hell is that?
- And he failed, so she goes to a party with Benno, who is now suggesting drugging her. Shit just went to another level out of nowhere.
- Well, we get the famous balcony scene, on some level.
- And an actual fight scene. Roxy's and Rick's noses are fountains of blood. Probably the most exciting part so far outside of the rap battles.
- And Roxy learns that Benno was betting he could film her having sex. And she blew the fuck up
- Now we learn that the initial rumor was her helping a gay friend appear not gay by being locked into a closet with him. How the fuck did these students know about it? It happened in England, and they're in Germany. Did they get official transcripts? It'd be like my High School knowing the drama of a transfer student from freaking South Carolina. How the fuck does that make sense?
- Cyril is now crying because he didn't get the girl.
- And now Rick is coming across as kind of an ass. He learns that she's okay with him being ugly, and he gets angry at her. That's completely different from every other version.
- Plus, Rick and Cyril become enemies. Since when is that a thing? Even if they're rivals, they are deep and respecting friends, which is what makes Christian such a good foil to Cyrano and vice-versa
- Seriously? We do the Tirade du Nez within the last portion of the fucking movie? I get why, but it's still missing several of the reasons why the scene works.
- Oh Christ, they're adding inspirational music, like it's some triumphant scene. Fuck off. His bravado was meant to hide his insecurity, not the other way around.
- Okay, pause and prediction.They're back at the college rap battle from the beginning. Roxy realized that Cyrano was the man in the mask from earlier, and we know she can rap. She's going to pop in to challenge "Masked Man", and call him out for all the lies through a rap battle.
- Yep, happened just like I thought.
- Wait, half of this rap battle is just making fun of Rick. Come on man.
- Now it's getting weirdly personal, like "I lie awake in bed waiting for my best friend." The audience must be confused as fuck, rofl
- And Cyril gets the girl and the movie ends. 

### Overall Thoughts:
##### As A Movie:
It's fairly good when it comes to cinematography, and the acting appears above bar, though a bit muted. By itself, the plot is fairly boring, as it fits most of the regular tropes of quiet outcast finding confidence in themselves, typically through applying some special talent that wows their previous bullies. Most of the drama that exists in the movie takes forever to move, and most of the decisions made by the characters are basically meaningless, except for a few portions.

##### As An Adaptation:
This was a genuinely frustrating adaptation for me to watch. Cyril is Cyrano without any sense of Panache, who basically knows how to rhyme and little else. Hell, they try several times to show that he's smart by showing that he reads books, and that's about it. Every time he's bullied, he just nods along, or plays right into their bullying. No pride, no flare, and almost no wit throughout. Hell, even his flirting with Roxy, which are his wittiest moments, he shows basically a normal conversation level of wit and humor. He's not terribly bad. Rather, he's just boring, which is the worst thing a Cyrano imitation can be. Even a bad Cyrano is entertaining in how dramatically they fail.
Rick, as a stand-in for Christian, is genuinely the worst one I've seen. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. It takes what most get wrong about him, which is to make him obscenely stupid, and make it so that he's a barely functioning person. He's more likely to need serious medical help than basic counseling. Plus, the relationship between Rick and Cyril is antagonistic, which is in stark contrast to almost every other version, where they at least respect each other, even if they are rivals. The last we see of Rick is him screaming at Cyril about how he's ugly and a psycho, and Cyril only insults him after that. One of the worst dynamics I've seen yet.
Roxy is, as is the pattern, the character that comes out the best. They do a good job of showing her as a clever woman who does take an active role in how things play out, and most of the deviations from the original are understandable given the relative backstory that Roxy has here, which is that she keeps getting into trouble, and people get hurt. So, her outbursts and anger are justifiable, as they are linked towards what motivates and hurts her. The core of Roxanne is still there, just now in a bubble of teenage angst. This is definitely a pattern.

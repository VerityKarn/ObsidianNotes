#### Notes:
- Ellie = Cyrano, Aster = Roxanne, Paul=Christian
- Starting this out with a reference to Greek myth, which I'm going to look up
	- Right, so not exactly a myth of the Greeks. It's a story told by Aristophanes within *The Symposium* by Plato. It's a sort of Atlantis problem, where it's ascribed as myth, when it's actually an allegorical tale meant to explain the differences between man and woman, and how love is actually a coming together of the different aspects of humanity. Then Socrates responds, and so forth.
- "The Greeks never went to high school" No, but they could be just as petty.
- Now we're bringing in Camus to say that life is meaningless. Fucking quick way to get my blood boiling, but I get that is a fairly common reading. Only if you read *The Stranger* or *The Plague*. *Caligula* and *The Myth of Sisyphus* explain beyond the nihilism.
- Alright, setting up the big final act. Winter Talent show, or something.
- And this Cyrano apparently sells their homework to other students. Does that really make them an outcast? Usually those people were fairly popular. Rich, and took work away from others.
- Oh god, and now it's No Exit by Sartre. This movie is just dripping in philosophical name dropping.
- Followed up by our Cyrano extensively knowing Plato. Guess that's a reference to the original reference in *The Symposium*.
- Guess we have our Christian now. And this is them asking for a letter, which Ellie turns down
- Just realized that the father is Seraph from the Matrix trilogy. Fucking wild.
- And we get our first time with Aster. Turns out she's witty and booksmart. Alright. Now let's see if they give her active participation.
- And our Christian, Paul, can't write a letter. But, he doesn't seem illiterate or moronic.
- Random Oscar Wilde quote.
- Aster taking the first blow. That's actually pretty clever.
- Turns out Paul works across the street. And they are actually showing him to be a loveable dork. Not exactly a beacon of intelligence, but a good people's person, and a genuinely hard worker.
- Interesting. Aster is the one struggling with finding independence and their own freedom. That's a pretty good way of modernizing the machinations that Roxanne would often find herself in.
- There's a running theme here, and it actually fits very well with some of what made Cyrano so compelling. What does it mean to be liked and popular? Is that different from being an outcast substantially? Or is it an exploration of different types of freedom and control?
- Started laughing at about 20 minutes in because there was some dude that looked like shaggy from the live action movies.
- Apparently, Ellie stopped doing homework for other people to focus on the letters.
- And, we've changed to exchanging notes on a painting. Creative.
- I'm liking the dynamic here. And Paul now potentially ruining it by being headstrong. He does get that he messed up. I'm liking how they portrayed Christian here. Endearing, nervous, headstrong, but genuinely well-meaning.
- Paul actually standing up for Ellie. Hell fucking yeah
- And he's actually trying to read the literature suggested him. Hell fucking yeah.
- Aster laughs at horror movies. Do not let her go, you insane monsters
- Holy shit, Paul understood No Exit. This is genuinely one of the best adaptations so far
- The family screaming at each other over dinner got a good laugh out of me. Had a number of those myself when I was younger.
- Paul has a genuine interest in Ellie now.
- Paul is now my favorite character. He's such a lovable and genuine dork with a heart of gold.
- Paul came so close to realizing that Ellie loves Aster
- This whole thing with taco sausages is a funny throughline. It's basically a hot dog
- Poor Paul. He's trying so hard.
- Alright, Paul pulling out a win. Let's go!
- Man, this is going to be so painful when the other shoe drops. Paul's such a good friend. Is he going to feel betrayed? 
- Oh, great pull into the dynamic. Ellie is socially awkward, so she doesn't understand the finer points of social interaction. Meanwhile, Paul is capable of reading social cues, and he knows how to coordinate clothing. Paul is the GOAT.
- Fucking small town vibes. Exaggerated, but definitely hitting close to home.
- What the fuck, jock dude?
- Okay, paused because I had a bit of a cringe moment there. My high school was a small town high school, and we did have one Chinese student and one Korean student. Everyone in the movie just yelled "The Chinese Girl!" at a party she just showed up at. There is no bloody way they wouldn't know their name. Everyone knew the names of the only two Asian students on campus, because they were so unique. Plus, one's family owned the chinese restaurant in town, which was a fun hangout spot for some students. There is no fucking way that they didn't know their name.
- Paul hovering around the new kid, and making sure they're okay. Been on both sides of that one now. Fun times. Also sweet.
- And Ellie has written the food critic to help Paul get noticed for his food creations. God, these two are such good friends. Sucks that it's going to come to bashing heads when Ellie's secret gets revealed.
- Well Aster is at Paul's place. Odd.
- Ellie, chill.
- Well, Ellie is now on a date with Aster. That's somewhat unexpected. It was going to happen at some point, but it's an interesting start to it.
- And Jesus Christ, shit got naked quick
- Paul and Ellie's Dad have such a fun dynamic.
- Wait, the high school team hasn't scored in 15 years?! What the fuck?!
- Wait, Paul fell in love with Ellie? What the fuck?!
- And Paul figures it out. Shit's about to go wrong
- Paul, WHAT THE FUCK?!
- Trig, shut the fuck up
- Paul has an old Lenovo. Nice. And now his family thinks he's gay. Didn't see that coming.
- Well, the religious aspect has been in the background for a while, but it's now at the forefront. Guess that's our catalyst.
- Trig, shut the fuck up
- And now Aster knows who texted her.
- Oh god, they reincorporated the chasing the train comment from earlier

### Overall Thoughts:
##### As a film:
This was a genuinely fantastic film. The acting, cinematography, the characters, the plot, and the style were engrossing. Paul especially ties a lot of this film together, as watching his journey was fulfilling in a way that I didn't expect. He started out as a lovable doofus, and then grew as a more aware and caring person throughout the film. His effort and his attentiveness was one of the best parts of the film, and it made the relationship he had with Ellie such a good dynamic. Ellie, in hand, learned to treat Paul in a much more endearing light, as she learned that his jock background was not what defined him. Each had preconceived notions of each other that broke down as the movie went on. Aster, while integral to the plot, was almost an afterthought for Ellie and Paul's friendship, with each of them learning how to situate themselves with each other and Aster.

##### As an adaptation:
Genuinely one of the better ones, if not one of the best ones. Many of the core aspects of each character is preserved, and each is taken into interesting directions. Paul is the Christian that has the space to push himself into the capabilities that were denied by the war in the original play. Aster is a Roxanne who seeks their own freedom from a world that assumes what she is meant to be. Ellie is the Cyrano that doesn't realize how their pride is negatively harming themselves and those around them. When the piper needs to be paid, everything comes together. It's not the classic Cyrano tale, but it does continue the same spirit for a different audience. I still prefer my romantic heroes, but this is what I would consider a good modernization of this tale for a different set of core values.

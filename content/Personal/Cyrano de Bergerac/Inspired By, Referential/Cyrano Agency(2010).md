- The movie certainly starts out rather funny, and it looks like this will be one that's more influenced by Cyrano, rather than a more direct adaptation.
- Okay, so it's more that a love agency takes the concept of Cyrano, and makes it the central selling point of their services. They even label their clients like they're the main stars of the Cyrano play. Alright, this is a more interesting take then most. Certainly a funny one above anything.
- Geez, they take their spy work seriously.
- It's more like a group of Cyranos that train up a client list of Christians.
- Well, the first client they're showing seems to be working.
- They held auditions for spies and plants, I'm fucking losing it.
- Holy shit, it works. That's some good shit.
- A cut in gag that actually worked? Jesus, I'm enjoying this in the first ten minutes.
- These agency characters are a riot. Wacko Professionals who are serious about their work, but also off-kilter.
- They went down to strengthening the rain with a fucking rain machine.
- Also, for the low budget aspect, the shot composition is tight.
- So the first client was, I suppose, the set up for what this agency does. Another client came in, and I'm guessing this will be the main focus of the movie.
- Ah, the agency people wanted to have a theatre. Now the boss is thinking of moving towards that. But they have debts.
- Now the boss is marking up the price to the new client. Prediction time: the girl the client wants is the same one that the boss wants. This is the Cyrano vs Christian portion.
- The boss is now using his personal knowledge to supplement the case
- There are some interesting aspects of Korean culture here, such as the inability to speak out against authority, and how that's proposed for the case. Though, it's all so the mark can fail. The boss is playing the long con here, lol
- Ah, but it backfires. He was trying to make him unappealing, but it made him someone worth looking at for her.
- Yep, it's a classic blunder of trying to trip someone up, and accidentally making it better for them.
- Boss still hasn't told his team what's up. That's going to bite him in the ass, almost for sure.
- Interesting Opera sequence, which only hints towards the past these characters shared.
- Ah, his co-worker figured it out.
- Oh, they were engaged at one point. That's a different dynamic.
- There must be some cultural significance with peaches and them being rotten that I'm unfamiliar with.
- And now the co-worker is doing a good job of ribbing the boss.
- Turns out that the client might be involved in shady loans, which is a regular problem in Korea, if I'm remembering correctly
- Boss got caught drinking and driving, and meets again with the target, which reminds him of how they met. Turns out there is a bit more to the similarities between the boss and the client.
- Dude, some shots in this are fantastic.
- Holy shit, they actually explain Cyrano to the Client
- Oh, it's the group's favorite play, and why they got the idea for the love agency. That's a damn good nod.
- It's not a Cyrano fight scene, but a damn funny one.
- Holy shit, the boss moves fast.
- And he gets handsy when drunk.
- The other shoe is going to drop, that's for sure.
- Oh shit, he saw them!
- Well that went all sorts of wrong, for everyone.
- Oh, turns out that the first client was a bastard, and that's about to ruin the business.
- Genuinely losing myself to this movie. The drama has kicked in full, and it's engrossing.
- Oh shit, they have the 1950s Cyrano in the film. And it inspires the boss to action. Fuck yeah.
- Please don't fuck up this ending. I just realized that there's still more movie left. You're at the perfect tempo. Don't throw in a wrench.
- The loan shark is back. Guess that's the wrench in the ending
- I honestly think this is the first Cyrano adaptation I've seen that has a happy ending for Christian.
- Just how many ending scenes are there? Is this the Korean Lord of the Rings?
- Well, apparently the boss and the assistant are going to hook up. Guess that would be explored in the show, but I don't know if I'll watch that.

### Overall Thoughts:
##### As a standalone movie:
Genuinely a great piece of film. The pacing was superb, even if it got a bit wonky towards the end, the comedy was on-point for most of the film, even for a non-Korean speaker, and some of the shots were just great to look at. It's no wonder that the film became a sleeper hit in Korea, and managed to get a television drama based on it. Though, that only lasted one season due to poor viewership. Genuinely fun and heartwarming film, I would highly recommend it.

##### As an adaptation:
There are two main elements at play here: cultural differences and original intent. To begin with, there are several plot points and character differences that essentially translate over from French to Korean, which the film directly acknowledges in some of the dialogue. They are aware of the link to Cyrano, and they sometimes play into those roles, while also commenting how they are different. The Boss is Cyrano, but more the rambunctious, head-strong Korean trope of a man continually down on his luck. The Client is Christian, but now the Korean stereotype of hopeful entrepreneur that can't find the balance between work and life. The Target is Roxanne, but aligns with the Korean trope of a clever, sophisticated lady. Each of these translations are done well, much like how Samurai Saga translates the characters into Feudal Japanese tropes.
As for intent, the plain text tells us exactly how this story was meant to relate to the original Cyrano. It is not a direct translation, but more of an inspired original story. The biggest tell is the final confession scene, where the character who resembles Christian actually mentions him as a motivator for himself. This isn't supposed to be the same story, but one that derives from it, which is different from Samurai Saga. One is a direct retelling, but moved to a different form, while the other is an inspired retelling, meant to play around with the story. For me, this is not only satisfactory, but genuinely thrilling to see. It's also the first time that we see our Christian, the Client, get an actual win, because they are aware of the type of story that they are in. Good. Genuinely one of the few adaptations that gives Christian the fucking respect he deserves, instead of just making him a bumbling idiot.

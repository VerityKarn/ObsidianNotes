### Main Ideas:
- Cyrano de Bergerac is an influential piece of art that is also somewhat obscure to a largely American audience, making it an oddly well-known obscurity.
	- We could call it "obscurely influential", as the original play is not part of people's typical cultural repertoire for reference, such as Star Wars, Marvel, or Harry Potter. 
	- Likely, people know the word "panache", meaning a sense of flamboyant confidence or courage, but don't realize that the modern usage of the word started with Cyrano. Prior to the play, it was seen as a negative trait of excessive boasting, while Cyrano embraced it as a strength.
- Still, there are plenty of modern interpretations of the Cyrano story, which many might not know as influenced by or adapted from Cyrano.
	- Personal anecdote here about co-workers of mine knowing about Roxanne(1987) and not the original Cyrano.
- I want to dive into many of the adaptations, and explain why some are seem to miss the mark.

#### Need to Rewatch for notes:


### Reoccurring mistakes I notice:
- Making the character for Christian stupid. Christian is not stupid, but not originally well-read and is bad with women. He is, however, witty and among the finest soldiers, which was considered a valuable form of its own, as it is said in the original, "Military Wit". He's a headstrong kid that's prone to mistakes, but not a dullard.
- In addition, they treat him like an obstacle to Cyrano, when the two were actually quite respectful towards one another, even if they were rivals. Christian sacrifices himself to give Cyrano a chance to confess, and Cyrano sacrifices his own happiness to give Christian a more peaceful death. Even when he's dying, Cyrano proclaims that it does not matter if the words were his, as the blood on the final letter belonged to Christian. It's a deep and moving loyalty to Christian's devotion and bravery.
- There is often the oversimplification of Cyrano being an outcast in adaptations. Cyrano was not just an outcast, but one that reveled in his ability to create enemies for himself. His famous "Non, Merci!" speech shows us that his status as an outcast is self-created, as he seeks freedom from political and social favor. His poetry is his own, and not to be edited or smudged by anyone else. In adaptations, this often turns the Cyrano stand-in as a bullied character, but usually without that self drive to stand out. They are just bullied, with some of them built to win over the bullies in the end. They usually have no Panache.

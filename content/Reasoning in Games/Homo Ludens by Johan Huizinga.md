(Important Note: The title is translated as the Play-Element *in* Culture, but Huizinga was very clear that he wanted it translated as the Play-Element *of* Culture.)

### Chapter Notes:

##### Foreword:
- Commentary on the idea of Homo Sapiens and Homo Faber, and then adds that Homo Ludens should be considered.
- Specifies that he is not talking about the Play Element "in" Culture, but the Play Element "of" Culture, specifying that the Genitive case best describes the relationship between Play and Culture.

##### I:
- Play predates and exists outside of culture, as it appears within animal behavior with no need for humans to introduce the behavior to them. Because of this, it is something more fundamental than culture.
- Explaining play as merely a physiological or psychological phenomenon is missing the significance of play as a function within behavior overall.
- While Huizinga doesn't dismiss these explanations of play, he finds the relationship a bit backwards. Specifically, these explanations try to explain play as fulfilling something that is not play itself, but is rather directed towards some end goal or purpose that is either social or biological. Yet, they don't answer what play is itself, and how it can be defined.
- Fundamentally, no one has a good enough answer for why play is "fun", and how it appears to fulfill that drive within humans. It's a total concept that can't be explained by deriving it towards other functions.
- Huizinga makes the argument that play is beyond rationalism, meaning mind separate from body, as it is irrational.
- According to Huizinga, Language and myth-making are products of play, and not the other way around. The need to describe, to modify, in other words, to play with ideas and concepts explains the growth of language, and the mythologizing of various portions of reality.
- Reference is made to the Aristotelian *animal ridens*, in which Aristotle makes the distinction of laughter for why humans are different from animals.
- Huizinga makes arguments towards how play is not in contention with the concept of seriousness. Rather, serious play is a common idea, while there are other non-serious acts that can not be directly called play, such as comedy.
- The first quality of play denoted by Huizinga is that play is freedom in some metaphysical sense. The second is that it is a stepping out from "real" life and exists in its own sphere. [[Homo Ludens by Johan Huizinga#^FirstQualities]]
- The third element of play is its distinctiveness from "ordinary" life, as a secluded form. It is distinct from life, but it leaves memories and ideas that form tradition and cultural phenomenons.
- Play transcends into ritual, but there is question about how.
- Sacred ritual, Huizinga argues, is another form of play. It is serious, just like other forms of play, but it transports its participants to another world, is played by distinct and iron-clad rules, and elevates its players into a realm of "freedom". It has all the hallmarks of play, even if it is not recognized as such.
- Overall, it appears that the first section was to address the link between play and ritual, especially religious and ancient ritual. I'm assuming that the remaining sections pull this out into other sectors of life. The next section is on Language.

##### II:
- Huizinga states that the baseline for the play-concept is closest to what is defined by "play" in English, which corresponds to the concept in other modern European languages. A definition is then laid out, with some examples.
- Huizinga then lays out that there are differences in how various languages encapsulate the concept of play, and that the linguistic development of these denote something more fundamental.
- He begins with Greek, where several aspects of the play-concept is split among different words with different etymologies. There is the concept for childish playing, and for contests.
- He brings up how other thinkers, namely "Professor Bolkestein", see this separation in Greek language as a fundamental contention to Huizinga's idea that contests and competition is linked to play, and that Huizinga is conflating two different ideas.
- Huizinga's response is to state that the separation of the words themselves are not sufficient enough reason to believe that the fundamental core of each is not connected in some way, and that the play-concept underlies both, rather than be separate.
- He continues to state that the Greeks had developed their rituals and contests to such a degree that they had begun to separate the concept from the fundamental core of the play-element, and thus developed the separation in language as a consequence.
- Huizinga then moves onto the play-concept as expressed in Sanskrit, and the four different words relate to the original concept, with some etymological examination to find commonalities.
- Then comes Chinese, where there are two different words that capture a similar divide as the Greeks, but with differing connotations.
- Finally is Blackfoot, a tribe of the Algonkin, and how they similarly separate out contests and child's play, though with slight differences in usage.
- Huizinga then doubles back to Bolkestein, in which he says that the Greek separation is not unique to the language, but appears to be within various, disconnected languages. As such, the mere separation of language is not sufficient to argue that it properly disconnects the two concepts.
- Huizinga then goes through Japanese, Semitic languages, and finally Latin. Of particular note is Latin, and how it separates out *ludus*(To play) from *jocus*(To joke/jest). Later Romance languages have adopted the latter to assume both(*jouer, juegar, jogar, giocare*), and *ludus* has disappeared as a word, even if the concept continues.
- What follows is the Germanic addition to the pool, where it had the broadest usage of the play-concept within language. The same branch of words could mean a variety of play activities.
- Then comes the English etymology of the word play, and how it's borrowed from several different sources, especially Anglo-Saxon.
- Huizinga then connects the linguistic play-concept to the linguistic contest-concept, demonstrating through several tales and songs that the words for play, battle, and contest tend to intermingle in usage.
- Huizinga then denotes two uses of play within language that appear to not fully encapsulate the play-concept, but can fall into it:
	- Music, in the sense of playing an instrument and of being a separate magic circle of being, can fall into the play-concept, but is not entirely within it, as other musical acts, such as singing, may not be fully captured by the linguistics of "play". One does not "play" their own voice, so to speak.
	- Romance by itself may fall into the usage of play in language, but the act of copulation itself falls out of it. Typically, the idea of play appears in romantic or sexual acts that are outside the norm, rather than the norm. One is "playing around" when they cheat, or they would be a "player" if they ignore typical courting norms.
- Finally, Huizinga notes that the language of play appears to be quite robust, while there is no simple word for the opposite of play. Tying back to the idea of seriousness, there is the word "earnest", which can denote that one is fervently working or focusing without play. Yet, play can be serious, so the presence of seriousness does not undermine the play-concept itself. Rather, seriousness can exist outside of play or within play. The lack of proper language to denote "not play" suggests the fundamental nature of the play-concept within culture.

### Notable Quotes:

##### Foreword:
>There is a third function, however, applicable to both human and animal life, and just as important as reasoning and making—namely, playing. It seems to me that next to Homo Faber, and perhaps on the same level as Homo Sapiens, Homo Ludens, Man the Player, deserves a place in our nomenclature.
>-Page ix
##### I:
>PLAY is older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing. We can safely assert, even, that human civilization has added no essential feature to the general idea of play. Animals play just like men. We have only to watch young dogs to see that all the essentials of human play are present in their merry gambols. They invite one another to play by a certain ceremoniousness of attitude and gesture. They keep to the rule that you shall not bite, or not bite hard, your brother's ear. They pretend to get terribly angry. And—what is most important—in all these doings they plainly experience tremendous fun and enjoyment. Such rompings of young dogs are only one of the simpler forms of animal play. There are other, much more highly developed forms: regular contests and beautiful performances before an admiring public.
>-Page 1

>In play there is something “at play” which transcends the immediate needs of life and imparts meaning to the action. All play means something. If we call the active principle that makes up the essence of play, “instinct”, we explain nothing; if we call it “mind” or “will” we say too much. However we may regard it, the very fact that play has a meaning implies a non–materialistic quality in the nature of the thing itself.
>-Page 1

>Nevertheless it is precisely this fun-element that characterizes the essence of play. Here we have to do with an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level. We may well call play a “totality” in the modern sense of the word, and it is as a totality that we must try to understand and evaluate it.
>-Page 3

>We shall try to take play as the player himself takes it: in its primary significance. If we find that play is based on the manipulation of certain images, on a certain “imagination” of reality (i.e. its conversion into images), then our main concern will be to grasp the value and significance of these images and their “imagination”. We shall observe their action in play itself and thus try to understand play as a cultural factor in life.
>-Page 4

>Now in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of civilized life have their origin: law and order, commerce and profit, craft and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primaeval soil of play.
>-Page 4/5

>We can say: play is non–seriousness. But apart from the fact that this proposition tells us nothing about the positive qualities of play, it is extraordinarily easy to refute. As soon as we proceed from “play is non–seriousness” to “play is not serious”, the contrast leaves us in the lurch—for some play can be very serious indeed. Moreover we can immediately name several other fundamental categories that likewise come under the heading “non–seriousness” yet have no correspondence whatever with “play”. Laughter, for instance, is in a sense the opposite of seriousness without being absolutely bound up with play. Children's games, football, and chess are played in profound seriousness; the players have not the slightest inclination to laugh. It is worth noting that the purely physiological act of laughing is exclusive to man, whilst the significant function of play is common to both men and animals. The Aristotelian animal ridens characterizes man as distinct from the animal almost more absolutely than homo sapiens.
>-Page 5

>If, therefore, play cannot be directly referred to the categories of truth or goodness, can it be included perhaps in the realm of the aesthetic? Here our judgement wavers. For although the attribute of beauty does not attach to play as such, play nevertheless tends to assume marked elements of beauty. Mirth and grace adhere at the outset to the more primitive forms of play. In play the beauty of the human body in motion reaches its zenith. In its more developed forms it is saturated with rhythm and harmony, the noblest gifts of aesthetic perception known to man. Many and close are the links that connect play with beauty. All the same, we cannot say that beauty is inherent in play as such; so we must leave it at that: play is a function of the living, but is not susceptible of exact definition either logically, biologically, or aesthetically. The play–concept must always remain distinct from all the other forms of thought in which we express the structure of mental and social life. Hence we shall have to confine ourselves to describing the main characteristics of play.
>-Page 5

>First and foremost, then, all play is a voluntary activity. Play to order is no longer play: it could at best be but a forcible imitation of it. By this quality of freedom alone, play marks itself off from the course of the natural process. It is something added thereto and spread out over it like a flowering, an ornament, a garment. Obviously, freedom must be understood here in the wider sense that leaves untouched the philosophical problem of determinism. It may be objected that this freedom does not exist for the animal and the child; they must play because their instinct drives them to it and because it serves to develop their bodily faculties and their powers of selection. The term “instinct”, however, introduces an unknown quantity, and to presuppose the utility of play from the start is to be guilty of a petitio principii. Child and animal play because they enjoy playing, and therein precisely lies their freedom.
>-Page 7

>Here, then, we have the first main characteristic of play: that it is free, is in fact freedom. A second characteristic is closely connected with this, namely, that play is not “ordinary” or “real” life. It is rather a stepping out of “real” life into a temporary sphere of activity with a disposition all of its own. Every child knows perfectly well that he is “only pretending”, or that it was “only for fun”.
>-Page 7 ^FirstQualities

>Any game can at any time wholly run away with the players. The contrast between play and seriousness is always fluid. The inferiority of play is continually being offset by the corresponding superiority of its seriousness. Play turns to seriousness and seriousness to play. Play may rise to heights of beauty and sublimity that leave seriousness far beneath.
>-Page 8

>Play begins, and then at a certain moment it is “over”. It plays itself to an end. While it is in progress all is movement, change, alternation, succession, association, separation. But immediately connected with its limitation as to time there is a further curious feature of play: it at once assumes fixed form as a cultural phenomenon. Once played, it endures as a new–found creation of the mind, a treasure to be retained by the memory. It is transmitted, it becomes tradition. It can be repeated at any time, whether it be “child's play” or a game of chess, or at fixed intervals like a mystery. In this faculty of repetition lies one of the most essential qualities of play. It holds good not only of play as a whole but also of its inner structure. In nearly all the higher forms of play the elements of repetition and alternation (as in the refrain), are like the warp and woof of a fabric.
>-Page 9

>Inside the play–ground an absolute and peculiar order reigns. Here we come across another, very positive feature of play: it creates order, is order. Into an imperfect world and into the confusion of life it brings a temporary, a limited perfection. Play demands order absolute and supreme. The least deviation from it “spoils the game”, robs it of its character and makes it worthless. The profound affinity between play and order is perhaps the reason why play, as we noted in passing, seems to lie to such a large extent in the field of aesthetics. Play has a tendency to be beautiful. It may be that this aesthetic factor is identical with the impulse to create orderly form, which animates play in all its aspects. The words we use to denote the elements of play belong for the most part to aesthetics, terms with which we try to describe the effects of beauty: tension, poise, balance, contrast, variation, solution, resolution, etc. Play casts a spell over us; it is “enchanting”, “captivating”. It is invested with the noblest qualities we are capable of perceiving in things: rhythm and harmony.
>-Page 10

>The player who trespasses against the rules or ignores them is a “spoil–sport”. The spoil–sport is not the same as the false player, the cheat; for the latter pretends to be playing the game and, on the face of it, still acknowledges the magic circle. It is curious to note how much more lenient society is to the cheat than to the spoil–sport. This is because the spoil–sport shatters the play–world itself. By withdrawing from the game he reveals the relativity and fragility of the play–world in which he had temporarily shut himself with others. He robs play of its illusion—a pregnant word which means literally “in-play” (from inlusio, Hindere or inludere). Therefore he must be cast out, for he threatens the existence of the play–community.
>-Page 12

>A play–community generally tends to become permanent even after the game is over. Of course, not every game of marbles or every bridge-party leads to the founding of a club. But the feeling of being “apart together” in an exceptional situation, of sharing something important, of mutually withdrawing from the rest of the world and rejecting the usual norms, retains its magic beyond the duration of the individual game. The club pertains to play as the hat to the head. It would be rash to explain all the associations which the anthropologist calls “phratria”—e.g. clans, brotherhoods, etc.—simply as play–communities; nevertheless it has been shown again and again how difficult it is to draw the line between, on the one hand, permanent social groupings— particularly in archaic cultures with their extremely important, solemn, indeed sacred customs—and the sphere of play on the other.
>-Page 12

>Summing up the formal characteristics of play we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside “ordinary” life as being “not serious”, but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means.
>-Page 13

>So that according to him we are dealing with a necessary mental process of transformation. The thrill, the “being seized” by the phenomena of life and nature is condensed by reflex action, as it were, to poetic expression and art. It is difficult to describe the process of creative imagination in words that are more to the point, though they can hardly be called a true “explanation”. The mental road from aesthetic or mystical, or at any rate meta-logical, perception of cosmic order to ritual play remains as dark as before.
>-Page 16

>In the form and function of play, itself an independent entity which is senseless and irrational, man's consciousness that he is embedded in a sacred order of things finds its first, highest, and holiest expression. Gradually the significance of a sacred act permeates the playing. Ritual grafts itself upon it; but the primary thing is and remains play.
>-Page 17

>Let us consider for a moment the following argument. The child plays in complete—we can well say, in sacred—earnest. But it plays and knows that it plays. The sportsman, too, plays with all the fervour of a man enraptured, but he still knows that he is playing. The actor on the stage is wholly absorbed in his playing, but is all the time conscious of “the play”. The same holds good of the violinist, though he may soar to realms beyond this world. The play–character, therefore, may attach to the sublimest forms of action. Can we now extend the line to ritual and say that the priest performing the rites of sacrifice is only playing? At first sight it seems preposterous, for if you grant it for one religion you must grant it for all. Hence our ideas of ritual, magic, liturgy, sacrament and mystery would all fall within the play–concept. In dealing with abstractions we must always guard against overstraining their significance. We would merely be playing with words were we to stretch the play–concept unduly. But, all things considered, I do not think we are falling into that error when we characterize ritual as play. The ritual act has all the formal and essential characteristics of play which we enumerated above, particularly in so far as it transports the participants to another world.
>-Page 18

>The play–mood is labile in its very nature. At any moment “ordinary life” may reassert its rights either by an impact from without, which interrupts the game, or by an offence against the rules, or else from within, by a collapse of the play spirit, a sobering, a disenchantment.
>-Page 20

>We must ask whether this formal similarity entitles us to extend the qualification “play” to the consciousness of the holy, the faith embodied in these higher creeds. If we accept the Platonic definition of play there is nothing preposterous or irreverent in doing so. Play consecrated to the Deity, the highest goal of man's endeavour—such was Plato's conception of religion. In following him we in no way abandon the holy mystery, or cease to rate it as the highest attainable expression of that which escapes logical understanding. The ritual act, or an important part of it, will always remain within the play category, but in this seeming subordination the recognition of its holiness is not lost.

# Day One - Meet and Greet/Intro
- Students share their reasoning for pursuing the class
	- One has a personal connection to portions of the Greek Civil War
	- Two others expressed a desire to extract history from peoples which likely did not have the capability to imprint their own history on the record
		- Wald expands on that, stating that much of history is reading and understanding both interpretations, but to also embody the understanding of the time period(such looking at the history of science prior to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics)
- Discussion was had about historical anniversaries, and how some of them changed over time. Focus mostly on September 11th
- Audio of Chamberlain's speech of declaration of war on September 3rd, 1939 declaring war against Germany to the nation
- Discussion is had about about the audio and observations from students
	- Focus is on what was happening at the time, including Hitler's policies at the time
	- There is also the idea of focusing on what may have been on the minds of British citizens, and how this affected the tone and language of the speech(Less than two decades since WW1)
	- There's also some comment made on how Chamberlain was seen at the time, and why his policies prior to the speech directed the seriousness of the speech, as well as how his reputation changed over time
	- Wald states that WW1 is likely the most important event of the 20th century, as it set the tone and policies for the the coming decades and century(Modernization of War, massive loss and grief shaping political movements and policy, etc.)
- DVD is played for the class featuring the laying of stones in remembrance of Jews, each with an individual name noting where they were taken from.
# Day Two - Reflections on Zweig's Memoir
- Prior to class, we were asked to read from the first three chapters of the memoir "The World of Yesterday" by Stefan Zweig. The general assignment was to read through and get an image of the world that was being described. More of a feel than rational exercise. The time period was prior to WW1, when the Hapsburg Empire was still around, in Vienna.
- Wald lays down that much of the early classes will be establishing foundation. We'll get to the books later.
- A discussion is had between individual students about the reading.
- Class is brought back to a wide group to give their thoughts about the reading.
	- Emphasis is made on the events that followed after the events of the first chapter
	- Language used which emphasized the particular security
	- Wald explains the use of the word security in that the time period had no real concept of danger, which is contrasted by the world the author experienced afterwards
	- A small conversation arises about whether the author is bitter or nostalgic, with decent evidence for both.
	- [The Blue Angel film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020697/)
# Day Four -
- Reiterating what was spoken about last class, and comparing how the two chapters were received.
- A documentary is shown regarding the projects of Goring, who focused on shaping the Polish forest into something that was more "German".
	- There was a massive project to remove and kill the citizens of the  Forest, with the end goal of claiming several species, including the Bison.
	- Part of this was to re-create the idea of the old German romantic idea of the hunter.
	- They also had a program where they attempted to breed an aggressive auroch specifically for hunting. Several were released into the wild, which caused some chaos.
	- Overall, much of this reflected the Nazi ideas of creating their world to fit their worldview.
# Day 5 - 
- Put into groups to discuss the readings, and then recoalesced to discuss
# Day 7 - Mosse Ch. 4-5 Discussion

- Ties to modernity and the general rise of the reclamation of nature in response to industrialization and urbanization.
- Portion of the discussion centered around the concept of decadence, and how it related to ideas of masculinity
# Day 8 - Mosse Ch. 6-7 Discussion
- Part of the wider process of coming to terms with the war can be seen in the shifts in language and imagery that exploded both during and after the First World War.
- Cultural differences, a recurring theme within the book, does play a part in how strongly particular images appear throughout the text
- We're shown a particular memorial, which includes the poem, In Flanders Fields.
- Shown a portion of a documentary regarding Leni Riefenstahl, who was a cinematographer who did work for the Nazi party.

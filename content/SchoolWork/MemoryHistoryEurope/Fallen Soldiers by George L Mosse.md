### Chapter 1: Intro
- A large focus of this book, according to the author, is the shift in people's experience with massive amounts of death, directly as a result of the increase in technological prowess of fighting nations. Some numbers are given of several previous wars, showing the massive spike in deaths from WW1, the main focus.
- The realities of trench warfare introduced new confrontations of death among millions along the front lines. Isolation of squads, snipers, and the charges all made death persistent. 
- An interesting development was the mixture of pride and mourning that was found in those who participated in the war. There was a sense of national duty and comradery that was mixed with the terrible sense of loss.
- Mosses states that this created the Myth of the War Experience, which sanctified the war as a symbol of national pride, with fallen soldiers especially upheld to be the symbols of that pride. 
- Many of these attitudes came not only from those on the homefront, but would often be exemplified by those who participated in the wars, usually through their writings of first-hand experience. Typically, these would come from volunteer soldiers, who were already primed to believe in the cause.
- While WW1 was the height of the Myth of the War Experience(MWE), the first portions of the book will look at the foundations laid down by previous conflicts, mostly in the French Revolution and German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon. Then, the book will focus on WW1 as the height of the MWE creation, and continue towards WW2 to see it's continuation for national identity and pride.
## Part 1: Foundations
### Chapter 2: Volunteers in War
- The volunteers for the Revolutionary Army of France grew at an astonishing rate in 1792, with most seemingly coming from upper-middle class families. In 1793, conscription was put into place, and it was more difficult to keep them interested in joining, as draft evasion and desertion rose.
- There became a general myth of volunteer soldiers as typically patriotic and excitable middle-class, educated citizens of a nation, in comparison to legions made with mercenaries, vagabonds, and destitute conscripts.
- The rise of citizen-soldiers began to change the outlook many had regarding the profession of soldier, as it was now seen as an occupation of potential neighbors who held their nation in high regard.
- An additional factor was the interconnection between the ideals of the soldiers and their acknowledgement by the state. Prior, soldiers fought mostly for the pay. The French Revolution had soldiers who fought for ideals and symbols. Equally, these soldiers started to become symbols themselves, with the French Republic era integrating soldiers into festivals and customs, as a way to represent the state.
- This became especially prevalent in the German wars for Liberation against Napoleon, where a large group of volunteer soldiers rose up for a mixture of reasons, including the idea of German unity and strength, and the concept of the "Volk's soul"
- A large method of this energy and myth was found in the outpouring and elevation of poetry and music that perpetuated the bravery and commitment of the citizen-army, with much of this becoming part of the national identity, and some being adopted into national anthems.
- A persistent theme throughout many of these writings was the sense of comradery, as soldiers were now being displayed as brothers-in-arms, or as equal citizens from the same nation.
- Though, desertion from the Free Corps, the volunteers of the Prussia/German forces, was actually quite high, as many found it unpalatable to their sense of heroism and bravery.
- Still, the myth persisted, as images of a band of brothers was formed around the Free Corps and other volunteer groups, with many of them gaining recognition from their governments as vital pieces of the military.
- Several other factors, such as the rise of "manliness" and freedom as values, led into the concept of the citizen-soldier being elevated as an ideal for young men during the time.
- Mosse does state that volunteer soldiers existed in every conflict throughout the 19th century, but that not all of them contributed to the MWE, including the English Volunteer Force. The biggest factor appears to be the presence of Romanticized idealisms and national pride alongside the usage of volunteer forces, such as in France and Germany.
- An example is made of the Greek War of Independence(1821-1831) on how the romanticization of war is mixed with national feelings, in that the ancient ideas of Greek culture mixed with the sense of reclaiming that which was wholly European from the Turks.
- There was also the addition of exoticism mixed with foreign travel in the Greek War, as many coming from outside Greece saw it as a way to "see the world", and to play a pivotal role in what was shaping up to be a historic war.
### Chapter 3: Building the Myth: Tangible Symbols of Death
- With the usage of Christian symbols and nomenclature to capture the essence of the war, Germany's war against Napoleon took on a sanctified, religious fervor to it.
- The full extension of this came with what Mosse calls the "Cult of the fallen soldier", in which the death of these soldiers was placed at a higher moral level, essentially acting as martyrs for the cause.
- Festivals, ceremonies, and commemorations began which exalted and symbolized the dead who had sacrificed themselves for the wider cause.
- It was generally after the French revolution that soldiers were treated equally in death, as previous wars usually separated the officers and the common rank.
- There is some commentary about how burial practices overall shifted within the era, in that specifically the idea of sanitation led to more burials outside of municipals than within, which led to further credence to the concept of ideas
- Generally, a lot of this is arguing towards the idea that the concept of death itself was being more and more removed from people's average lives. Cemeteries were being moved away from populaces, and people's interactions with death itself was being moved more towards the ceremonial aspects of death, including elaborate funerals and graves, more so than actually confronting death.
- A large portion of this was the movement of death towards "natural" settings, in which the death was not viewed as a fact of human life, but as a part of nature itself.
- War memorials were a regular part of previous life, with many nations dedicating their war efforts into monuments towards typically generals and officers. These would often take the shape of fantastic figures as statues or as classical objects, such as an obelisk.
- Finally, there is a note regarding the link between Christianity and individual death, and how these would be interconnected through various religious holidays, such as Easter or Good Friday.

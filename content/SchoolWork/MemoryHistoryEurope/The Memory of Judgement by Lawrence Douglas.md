## Introduction
- The book appears to be a direct response to two major thoughts regarding a series of trials dealing with specifically the Holocaust. There is the response against the controversial figure Hannah Arendt, who specifically commentated on the Eichmann trial, the most famous of the Holocaust Trials. He briefly lays out her argument, and responds
	- In short, Arendt believed that the Eichmann trial was more akin to a Soviet "show trial", in which justice itself is secondary to the appearance of justice for the sake of establishing fake legitimacy. Douglas agrees that it is, to an extent, a "show trial", but that it is because the court is serving both as a legal proceeding, but also as a form of historical record making. It is establishing a narrative alongside the law.
## Part 1: Nuremberg
## I: Film as Witness
- A particular note about the Nuremberg trials was that there was a noticeable sense of boredom that appears to be unique to this trial. Some of the factors that caused this was multivariate, as there were four countries that were conducting the trials, and various strategies that did not mesh. Often, different charges would require evidence to be re-read, making the proceedings repetitious. Equally, there was the American strategy of overwhelming documentation in order to combat the undermining of eyewitness statement, requiring much to be added to the record vocally.
- Yet, this was also seen as necessary, as many, especially the Americans, believed that the sheer scale of the German crimes would lead to accusations of exaggeration and propaganda. By providing overwhelming documentary evidence, they hoped to cut that strategy at its knees.

# Day 1 - Introduction
- End project is going to be a roughly 20 page paper based on research
- First half of the course will be focused on the text book, which gives a somewhat detailed overview of the history of Europe, mostly to set up the framework for everyone to operate in. Historical documents and primary sources will be introduced
- Some ideas are given for potential project focuses
- We do an examination of a box that was given out to British soldiers during the first Christmas of WW1. Special attention is given to some of the symbolism. Wald than reads a note given by the princess who commissioned the boxes. The contents of the boxes are read out to the class. Costs of manufacturing and shipping the boxes turned out to be too much, leading to roughly 1/3rd getting the boxes in total.
- An example is made of the Katyn massacre, in which the Soviet and German forces blamed each other for the deaths of 15000 soldiers of the Polish Exile government. While evidence existed, it wasn't until 1990 that an official apology was given by Russia, during the period of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
- This was given as an example of archive information, as part of the story came from the Autobiography of Churchill. This is demonstrated by showing a passage from the book that cuts off a portion from an official transcript, which may likely change the interpretation of events.
- The last portion of the class was watching a documentary about the influence of western ideas, powers, and culture within what is usually seen as traditional cultures.
# Day 2 - Examining Natalie Davis
-  Prior to the class, we were tasked to read both works by and about Natalie Davis, including her most popular book The Return of Martin Guerre. The idea was to get a good picture of both her work and method, and the public perception of the historian and her work.
- Part of understanding the method of Davis is to understand what questions of history she was pursuing, and how those questions shaped what narratives she tackled.
- Davis' focus on individuals, especially from backgrounds that don't get much airtime, brought out views and understandings of how individuals dealt with the world around them at the time, especially in comparison of the wider narratives of history.
- Discussion surrounding her academic publications
	- One focuses on the definitions of the Renaissance, with Davis bringing up the missed portions of the era(women and peasants).
	- The other idea of the Renaissance individual, exemplified by people like Leonardo da Vinci.
	- Therefore the central question of the piece, "Did Women have a Renaissance?"
	- Davis focused on several factors to find that there may have been a regression, as argued by some of her contemporaries, for women during the Renaissance.
- Finally, conversation around The Return of Martin Guerre
	- Large emphasis is placed on the density of the footnotes, especially for smaller statements. When a claim is made of the past, Davis is bringing in several sources to create foundation for those claims.
# Day 4 -
- Discussion is had regarding the reading.
# Day 5 -
- Discussion points:
	- The technological reality of Rome, in that they were both a vast technological empire, but that the lack of pressure to change, either commercially or socially, kept them within a sort of floating point of stability
	- The various branches and problems of the early Christianity, especially the schism of the East and West, as well as the various ideas and groups that had to come together to make Christianity closer to the Christianity that we understand it today.
- Portion from a documentary shown regarding the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
# Day 6
- Presentation/Discussion started by two students in class
	- The concepts of these sections very much sets up the later portions of history
	- The importance of Christianity within these portions and how it played a far more unifying part in keeping the European identity singular in nature
# Day 7 - Medieval Civilization
- Presentation/Discussion
	- Much of the topics are a continuation of the previous, but it starts with how we even understand "middle ages", as a term.
	- How do attitudes towards a specific era effect how it's classified, and how do changes to those attitudes effect those in proximity of the era?
	- The idea of the state was tenuous during the period, leading to a devaluation in relation to the Roman Empire or the Renaissance.
	- The interconnectedness of the identities regarding France and England(The Norman conquests and intermingling of royal houses), leads to the Hundred Years War, in which each claims sovereignty of the lands, eventually leading to a full separation of the two into distinct national identities
# Day 8 - Launching Modern History
- Presentation/Discussion
	- The argument is made that this was the period of individualization and the change in thought turning towards individual thought and philosophical engagement.
	- The fragmenting of Christian identities and legitimacy led to a decrease in the central power of the Church as a force within Europe overall
	- The overall changing of power structures due to various smaller movements of early parliamentary systems
	- Rapid economic changes, which take a full effect among the citizens, including the slave trade
	-

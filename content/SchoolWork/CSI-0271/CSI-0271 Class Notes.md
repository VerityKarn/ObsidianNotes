# Day One - Meet and Greet/Intro
- Students share their reasoning for pursuing the class
	- One has a personal connection to portions of the Greek Civil War
	- Two others expressed a desire to extract history from peoples which likely did not have the capability to imprint their own history on the record
		- Wald expands on that, stating that much of history is reading and understanding both interpretations, but to also embody the understanding of the time period(such looking at the history of science prior to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics)
- Discussion was had about historical anniversaries, and how some of them changed over time. Focus mostly on September 11th
- Audio of Chamberlain's speech of declaration of war on September 3rd, 1939 declaring war against Germany to the nation
- Discussion is had about about the audio and observations from students
	- Focus is on what was happening at the time, including Hitler's policies at the time
	- There is also the idea of focusing on what may have been on the minds of British citizens, and how this affected the tone and language of the speech(Less than two decades since WW1)
	- There's also some comment made on how Chamberlain was seen at the time, and why his policies prior to the speech directed the seriousness of the speech, as well as how his reputation changed over time
	- Wald states that WW1 is likely the most important event of the 20th century, as it set the tone and policies for the the coming decades and century(Modernization of War, massive loss and grief shaping political movements and policy, etc.)
- DVD is played for the class featuring the laying of stones in remembrance of Jews, each with an individual name noting where they were taken from.

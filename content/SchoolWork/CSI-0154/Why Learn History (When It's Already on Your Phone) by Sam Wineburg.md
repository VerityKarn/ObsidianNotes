# Key Takeaway
# Notes
## Introduction
- The chapter starts with an example of a textbook that gained national interest, specifically because it featured information regarding battalions of black soldiers operating on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Further examination of the claims, when the author was asked, showed that they came from a highly biased group with no primary sourcing to back the claim.
- The author then references a study that they were involved with(linked above), which sought to evaluate students' capabilities of determining the reliability of online sources and information.
- Another example is given of [teachers in Rialto, California that implemented a test for students to determine whether the Holocaust actually occurred](https://www.sbsun.com/2014/05/04/exclusive-rialto-unified-defends-writing-assignment-on-confirming-or-denying-holocaust/), citing sources from anti-Semitic websites. Students subsequently argued for the Holocaust being a hoax, as they couldn't tell which sources were legitimate.
	- As a side note, the article above mentions that the superintendent for the school district had the name "Mohammad Z. Islam" which sounded like the fakest name one could create for a caricature of either a Muslim or an Arab person, but they are [actually a real person](https://www.sbsun.com/2014/07/27/despite-scandals-rialto-unifieds-interim-superintendent-wants-to-keep-job/). [LA Times article mentioning them again](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rialto-holocaust-assignment-20140507-story.html).
- The author stresses that much of this wasn't directly because of racism or insensitivity. Rather, it's a symptom of the current information age producing too much information for people to properly parse. Specifically, we don't have the tools to deal with too much information.
- They then conclude the intro by explaining the overview of the parts within the book, and the point of each particular part and chapter.
## Part 1 Our Current Plight
### Chapter 1
- Much of the first portion of this chapter goes through both the history of surveys conducted to determine average historical knowledge among several different groups, then talking about the media reporting on the response, including some extreme statements of the massive degradation of historical knowledge as a result of educational failure.
- The point of these examples was to show how the problem is not as simple as was reported. Rather, historical ignorance tends to be rather stable overall, with each generation having similar problems with retaining historical data.
- Instead, Wineburg places much of the burden upon the methodology of test-makers and examiners, in that they are specifically looking to create a normal distribution of performers. This is done by eliminating questions that are either universally answerable or universally unanswerable.
- There are some explanations and sources given for how standardized testing is created, and how it deviates towards the creation of questions that could not be answered by the majority of students.
	- I won't lie, but I'm getting a bit queasy about this. The last group, that I was directly involved with, that had these complaints regarding "standardized testing" was a group of radical evangelists that argued for policies such as jailing those who burned the flag and the establishment of a Christian theological government. They also fell into the group of those known as "unschoolers", which finds a direct lineage with writers such as John Holt, who argued for adult-child sexual relationships, and Ayn Rand.
	- This is not to say that I'm against the overall point. I do acknowledge that there are drawbacks to any form of "standardization", as the complexity of any system can not be fully encapsulated within strict bounds, and this is especially true for a field as complex as education. And, there is a decent amount of data to suggest that the objectives of test-makers does not properly align with educators. Yet, I'm hoping that the author does specify the difference between testing in-and-of-itself, and the utilization of poor testing models. The previous group could not understand the distinction.
- The next portion speaks about how the actual logic behind test-takers is not the same as either test-makers nor educators. Several examples are given of how a lack of historical knowledge can still lead to the correct answer, because there are several methods of utilizing inductive logic to determine the "most correct" answer.
	- This is almost exactly from John Holt's "Instead of Education", of which the central claim is that schools teach children how to take tests, and the subsequent criticism of "test logic", instead of internalizing information. I'm beginning to lose confidence here.
- The next portion then talks about the particular pedagogy of classroom education, as well as the problems that plague textbook creation. Specifically, the overwhelming problem of classroom history education is "boring" for students, and it continues to be. In addition, the committees for textbooks are often infiltrated by outside influences that have damaging agendas, especially in the direction of religious interests.
	- Alright, there is no way this guy wasn't influenced in one way or another by the homeschooling movement of the 1970s, which was spearheaded by people like Holt. Almost all of these points were circulated within the magazine set forward by the group, especially "Growing Without Schooling", of which the first copy came out in 1977. The majority of these magazines were constructed around personal stories of parents, most of which liked to use the words "bored", or "dull" to describe the effect that education had on their children. There are also multiple references to the textbooks being "authoritarian" and "dull". I'm almost out of good faith for this book.
-  It should be noted that the majority of examples regarding testing here is multiple choice tests, where the next section talks about the technology behind multiple choice exams. There's also the line "That a Depression-era technology still shapes the tests we give to students is a national shame". Guess we need to throw out Radar, Synthetic Rubber, and the expansion of messaging networks, all of which came out within the same era.
### Chapter 2
- The beginning portion of the chapter focuses on the campaign to make history its own subdivision within the Department of Education, which succeeded in 2000 mostly through the advocacy by Robert C. Byrd, the senator.
- A significant portion is devoted to the work done by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni(ACTA), which the author levies some arguments of bias against, including that they went after such figures as Reverend Jesse Jackson for "Anti-American sentiments".
- The next major focus is on the Teaching American History(TAH) program, which gave grant money to various local programs in order to improve the content and efficacy of American History education
- Essentially, the rest of the chapter is built around examining the shortcomings of TAH, and how much of the funds were used for causes that were not realized.
	- I won't lie, some of the good faith has been restored, though it was a bit touch-and-go there. The first chapter really made me worry that I would have to deal with a pure ideologue for the rest of the book. I'm now understanding that the overall claim is not "schooling is bad", but that "specific pedagogical approaches are bad". More specifically, I'm assuming at this point that the conclusion of the book is more "We must teach students to think historically, and most approaches have sucked at this". Which, sure, yes, that is a much more reasonable position than the first chapter led me to believe.
### Chapter 3
- Wineburg introduces the textbook *A People's History of the United States* by Howard Zinn, which has a complicated history itself of going from fringe textbook to mainstream. While there is some space here to examine its impact, Wineburg is more focused on the question of how the textbook teaches people to think historically.
- Wineburg then spends the next section criticizing the particular approach that Zinn took in constructing a narrative, specifying the use of cherry-picked anecdotes while ignoring data that may go against the narrative. A portion is dedicated to the approach of "yes-type" questions of history, where one seeks to find evidence to supply a pre-built narrative.
- The next section details how this approach manifested within the text through questions posed to readers. Particularly, readers are asked "yes/no" or "either/or" questions that skew towards only one answer, leading the reader down to one specific conclusion.
- The next section focuses on the selective removal of information, and how that utilizes the potential ignorance of the reader. In particular, Zinn makes a comparison of Nazi bombing campaigns during a selective portion of WW2 while ignoring other campaigns that were far more devastating, typically by design. Zinn compares the smaller bombing campaigns to bombing campaigns of the Allies which were far more devastating, but also occurred years apart, removing the context of how the overall situation changed over the course of the war.
- The next section focuses on the Zinn's narrative regarding the use of the Atomic bomb on Japan. In particular, much of the basis of Zinn's argument relied on entirely using secondary sources which often quoted secondary sources, which led to primary sources either becoming fabricated or highly misrepresented.
- There is also the incorrect use of counterfactuals. A historian will often use counterfactuals to deal with potential histories that did not occur, though there is no certainty to the outcome, and so there is often a hedging of the bet. Zinn states with clear confidence that the Japanese *would* have surrendered if they had been given one condition, with no proper references to back the claim.
- The next portion examines Zinn's approach to the 1950s Red Scare era of American History. Zinn roundly condemned HUAC as being frivolous and dangerous, stating that the beliefs behind their conception were unfounded. Wineburg counters this by providing evidence from both Soviet archives opened in 1992, especially those of Program Venona.
- What alarms Wineburg about Zinn's book is its popularity, and how it managed to not effectively move students towards historical thinking than past textbooks. Instead, it offered the same approach of absorbing a monolithic narrative of history without teaching students to properly analyze the historical context.
	- Alright, good faith fully restored. With all three chapters, it's clear that Wineburg is concerned about wider pedagogical approaches to history. This especially clears up the basis for why he vehemently opposed multiple choice testing. Holt's foundation for his criticisms of educational institutions were that they were evil organizations that sought to control and brainwash students, which he saw as part of a wider issue of youth empowerment and freedom. It's clear that Wineburg is concerned with how the testing tells us nothing about a student's capability to perform actual historical analysis, which he sees as a wider issue of education failing to teach historical thinking. Wineburg is not lambasting education itself, but how ineffective it has been. Very different levels of criticism.
## Part 2 Thinking Historically != An Amazing Memory
### Chapter 4
- The majority of the chapter is focused on the work of Benjamin Samuel Bloom,

- While Kant was highly influential, I typically see him as more important within the history of philosophy than a primary source of good knowledge
	- In this, it's less important to have a deep understanding of the entirety of Kant's work than to understand the historical context surrounding Kant. Specifically, what was he responding to, and who did it influence.
	- The best argument I find for this is the branch of phenomenology, which I view to be a far more robust and useful explanation for many of the "transcendental" ideas that Kant established. The branch likely only exists because of Kant, but one only needs a rudimentary grasp of Kant to explore Phenomenology.
- Yet, this is not to dismiss Kant's importance to modern philosophy. Phenomenology, specifically down the branch of Husserl, directly responded to Kant. Heidegger, having learned from Husserl, synthesized many of his critiques with the critiques of Nietzsche for existential phenomenology. Hegel's idealism is formed as a response to Kant, which went on to influence modern Marxist thought. And the majority of the philosophy of science today, while typically traced back to Hume, almost universally acknowledges some of the modifications made by Kant.
	- As a comparison, it is possible to engage with large swathes of modern philosophy without knowing Nietzsche, and find little difficulty. Yet, there are huge fields that require at least a passing understanding of Kant to be able to engage with significantly.
